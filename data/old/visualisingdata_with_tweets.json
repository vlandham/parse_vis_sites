    "meta": "<div class=\"post-info\">\n\t\t\t\tJanuary 29th, 2012 in\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/category/news/\" title=\"View all posts in news\" rel=\"category tag\">news</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>",
    "content": "<p>A couple of weeks ago Tableau <a href=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/about/blog/2012/01/tableau-70-live-15662\" target=\"_blank\">announced the launch of version 7.0</a> of their popular Business Intelligence and Visual Analytics software. To find out more about this development I invited Craig Bloodworth,Â a Tableau evangelist and consultant forÂ <a href=\"http://www.theinformationlab.co.uk\">The Information Lab</a>Â (a Tableau silver partner) to highlight some of the new data visualisation features and enhancements.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/new-features/7.0\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4741 alignnone\" title=\"Tableau7\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Tableau7-600x330.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"330\"></a></p><p>With their recently released version 7 Tableau Software haveÂ bought the data visualisation community a whole host of capability. While the team at Tableau are looking to invest $200m over the coming years in software R&amp;D they arenât against giving back to the community. As such the latest version of Tableau is always available for free in the form of Tableau Public for analysing and publishing public data. With that in mind letâs take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/new-features/7.0\" target=\"_blank\">great new features available in 7</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/sites/default/files/snippets/fm2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/sites/default/files/snippets/fm2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"560\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p>Much of what drives feature development is feedback from Tableauâs own customers and two of the most requested features, area charts and filled maps, can now be found in 7. Whatâs amazing about Tableauâs development strategy though is just how much work goes in to ensuring user interactions are intuitive in both building and consuming visualisations. This also applies to mapping where Tableau now even gone one step further than Google Local allowing panning 360â° around the globe allowing you to show Japan alongside North America (i.e. how they actually are). Maps will even auto centre on the region of greatest data density meaning, sadly, the UK may no longer be the centre of the world.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/sites/default/files/snippets/wrapped2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/sites/default/files/snippets/wrapped2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"562\" height=\"400\"></a></p><p>Outside of chart types v7 has revamped its unique âShow Me!â function. If youâre still comparing Show Me! to Excelâs chart wizard or are expecting the library of charts available to have doubled then be sure to read <a href=\"http://theinformationlab.co.uk/blog/2011/12/12/show-me-when-less-is-definitely-more.html\">my blog post on the matter</a>. By moving Show Me! to a floating window youâre able to see exactly what choosing that extra dimension or measure will do to your chart. Tableau keep getting better on their promise of a single paradigm interface, allowing you to maintain focus on the analysis while switching between chart types can be done in a single click.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/new-features/7.0\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-4742 aligncenter\" title=\"Tableau7(2)\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Tableau72-556x450.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"556\" height=\"450\"></a></p><p>For people whoâve used or interested in Tableau Server the latest version is a complete game changer. Not only does it maintain its role as a publishing repository for sharing interactive visualisations around an organisation in an instant, for consumption via a web browser or mobile device, but its new data engine transforms it into a portal for all your live and static datasets. Think of it as a library of every data connection youâll need without worrying about drivers, ports, server addressing, etc. Whatâs great is distributing your latest data model update to everyone in your team is as simple as pressing âpublishâ. No more shared network folders or complex version control, Tableau Server handles updates and distributes to all data users as needed.</p><p>While those are the main updates thereâs just no time to also detail 1-click sort, tooltip improvements, menu reorganisation, connections toÂ HadoopÂ hive &amp; VectorWise, ODBC improvements, continuous dates, server high availability and multi tenancy.</p><p>Instead why not download <a href=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/download\">Tableau Public</a> or a trial of <a href=\"http://www.tableausoftware.com/products/desktop/try\">Tableau Desktop</a> and try everything out for yourself?</p><p><em>If youâre interested in chatting to Craig about Tableau or getting the best from your companyâs data feel free to email himÂ <a href=\"mailto:craig.bloodworth@theinformationlab.co.uk\">craig.bloodworth@theinformationlab.co.uk</a>.</em></p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

Then, yesterday evening, Enrico posted a <a href=\"http://fellinlovewithdata.com/reflections/telling-stories\" target=\"_blank\">blog article</a> about his concern about the focus of storytelling in data visualisation.</p><p>Today, almost by celestial design, I want to share details of the <a href=\"http://datajournalismawards.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Data Journalism Awards</a>, the first international contest recognising outstanding work in the field of data journalism worldwide.

From the Guardian to the New York Times, La Stampa to Die Zeit, journalists and media organisations are experimenting with new ways of using data to improve reportage of complex issues and to give readers direct access to the sources behind the headlines. As Tim Berners-Lee says, âdata-driven journalism is the future.â To recognize and showcase outstanding work, as well as highlight best practices in this fast-growing field, the first international Data Journalism Awards (DJA) has been established this year.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Awards</span></strong><br>\nThere are three award categories awarded at both (i) national and international and (ii) local and regional levels to give a total of six prizes. The three categories are:</p><p>1. Data-driven investigative journalism<br>\n2. Data visualisation &amp; storytelling<br>\n3. Data-driven applications</p><p>Each of the six winners will win â¬7,500 a DJA certificate and a digital medal. Two runners up will receive DJA certificates and digital medals.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Who is it open to?</span></strong></p><p>It is important to note that this competition is not just open to journalists.

Of course, its simplicity makes it attractive to a far broader demographic but I know this is where much of the motivation for the development came from.</p><p>The functionality of Datawrapper is very simple. You just search for a data set (Excel, Google, web table), copy it, paste the contents into Datawrappers first screen and then follow the instructions to construct and customise the visualisation before copying the embed code and pasting it on to your own web page.Â At the moment there are five visualisation types available: Line, Bar, Pie, Table and, interestingly,Â <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2010/08/making-sense-of-streamgraphs/\" target=\"_blank\">Streamgraph</a>, but these options will be extended in due course.</p><p>The version launched will simply be a starter, with an ongoing cycle of development, enhancement and refinement.Â There has already been much interest in this offering and Dortmund Newspaper Ruhr Nachrichten has already demonstrated the use of the embeddable tool in a story published online yesterday.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.ruhrnachrichten.de/lokales/dortmund/Erstmals-wird-in-Dortmund-weniger-gegen-Hartz-IV-geklagt;art930,1565639\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4943\" title=\"DatawrapperExample\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/DatawrapperExample.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"585\"></a></p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>When you run a blog you are using this platform as a shop window to share your ideas, inspirations and thoughts. Eventually, after a certain amount of time and, I guess, success, you are lucky enough to establish enough of a profile that people start to invite you proactively for your opinions on subjects, without you having to encourage it! </p><p>One of the most common question I am asked these days is what sort of data visualisation I like the most.</p><p>It is clearly a very open-ended question and one that is hard to satisfactorily answer on the spot without later thinking more deeply and wishing to refine your response. Indeed, forming a pure and consistent conviction about what you like is difficult (for some) especially in such a rapidly growing and evolving field like data visualisation. </p><p>You may be currently caught up with the beauty of a flavour of the month project or have a particular persuasion towards a given designer or even a contemporary subject. You might marvel at the technical capability of a design but find yourself hypnotised by this technical competence above the resulting value of the visualisation. All these diversions can cause you to respond with a different answer to this type of question on each occasion it is asked.</p><p>Iâve been reflecting recently on what I truly consider to be my most âlikedâ demonstrations of this art form, particularly following my recent run of data visualisation training sessions, where the question popped up on a few occasions, and also in preparing for an article I am writing for <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OâReilly Radar</a>.</p><p>After a long mental trawl through over five years of active participation in this field Iâve concluded, perhaps unsurprisingly, that the visualisations I love are those that exhibit a very simple design execution but unlock seemingly disproportionately rich stories. I say disproportionately rich because they arenât complicated constructions and seem to give you more insightful return than the interpreting effort you are required to put in. Above all they respond emphatically to the âso what?â challenge you can pose to design solutions.</p><p>Here are two perfect examples of what I mean:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2010/07/visualisation-insights-1-the-visualisation-designer/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4925\" title=\"ItalyNewZealand\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/ItalyNewZealand.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"468\" height=\"70\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2010/07/visualisation-insights-1-the-visualisation-designer/\"><img src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/SpainSwitzerland.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"SpainSwitzerland\" width=\"481\" height=\"70\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4929\"></a></p><p>The first example above comes from Michael Deal, a US based designer, who was commissioned by sports manufacturer Umbro to produce visualisation designs for each match during the 2010 World Cup. I profiled Michael and his design process in my first <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2010/07/visualisation-insights-1-the-visualisation-designer/\" target=\"_blank\">Visualisation Insights article</a>.</p><p>What I love about this approach is the fact you can unlock such a detailed story from this small, dense and straightforward display. Plotted over the duration of a match, the green lines are the passes made by each team, the blue triangles are the shots on goal and the red dots are goals scored. This reveals so much about the possession and position of each team, the ebb and flow of attacks, the penetration of attacking play, the effectiveness of defensive tactics, the opportunism of some who score with few shots, the profligacy of others. Regardless of your liking of the sport, whether you recall or even care about the matches themselves, you cannot fail to see the story unfold in these little gems.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.thomson.co.uk/blog/infographic/rugby/index.html#EngWal07\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4924\" title=\"DataVizLikes-Rugby\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/DataVizLikes-Rugby-600x410.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"410\"></a></p><p>In this next piece produced for <a href=\"http://www.thomson.co.uk/blog/infographic/rugby/index.html#EngWal07\" target=\"_blank\">Thomson Sport</a>, the display is even simpler, with just two lines plotting the incremental points tally for the opposing Rugby Union teams across an array of Six Nations encounters, but what you get is a fascinating path of how leads were built, deficits were reduced, the periods of deadlock, the swing of potential victory from one side to the other, the moments when a lead becomes unassailable. Maybe it is the unique scoring of Rugby which lends itself to such analysis but, as with the example above you, see a rich story emerge from the simplest of encodings and with so very little effort on your part as the reader.</p><p>There are many other examples I could have used, but these two stand out for me as super demonstrations of how data visualisation can unlock patterns in data that would otherwise remain unseen. Furthermore, as I have mentioned before, there is something incredibly elegant about a visualisations that successfully portrays a story in static form.</p><p>Iâve shown you my hand, so letâs see what youâve got!</p><p>Take a step back from the relentless stream of great new works, what are the examples of data visualisation you truly think reflect the practice at its finest? What type of designs do you most consistently âlikeâ?</p><p>Stick a comment in the box below, share links to your examples and explain why the choice you have made strikes such a chord with youâ¦</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

The base layer of this map shows an interpolation of global travel time into Vancouver. Because diseases vary in their latency periods, a person flying from one city to another may board an airplane infected but asymptomatic, and only develop symptoms while in the air or upon arrival at their destination city. By understanding the temporal nature of diseases, one can make better recommendations towards entry and exit screening at airports.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.biodiaspora.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4780\" title=\"VancouverOlympics_BioDiaspora\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/VancouverOlympics_BioDiaspora-582x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"460\"></a></p><p>The final image shows travel out of Hong Kong to the rest of the world during the month of November, one of the worldâs busiest air travel hubs. </p><p>With an overlay of both flight pathways and passenger volume intensity, one is able to see the zones which have the most passengers arriving from Hong Kong. The line chart at the bottom shows the monthly number of passengers leaving Hong Kong over a projected 12 year period. Interestingly, passenger volumes display consistent patterns in their seasonal growth and decline over time. Even when a major event impacts travel, patterns return to their normal ways after a fairly short period of time.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.biodiaspora.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4781\" title=\"HongKongTravel_BioDiaspora\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/HongKongTravel_BioDiaspora-600x397.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\"></a></p><p>So how were these visualisations created?</p><p>All images were created with ESRIâs ArcGIS suite, and edited through Adobe Creative Suite. For the flight lines, raw flight data was obtained and processed, and the flight paths were calculated through Python scripting. The Bio.Diaspora technical team now focuses much of their time on web application development. We are also exploring other methods of data visualization, specifically 3D interactive techniques created in Processing and alternative ways of displaying data with and without the use of geographic maps.</p><p>If you want to find out more about Bio.Diasporaâs work, visit their <a href=\"http://www.biodiaspora.com\" target=\"_blank\">site</a> or follow them on their new <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/biodiaspora\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter account</a>.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Back in November 2011 you may recall Visualizing.org ran a number of <a href=\"http://www.visualizing.org/marathon2011-details?city=london\" target=\"_blank\">visualisation marathon events</a> for students to compete in 24 hour competitions. Having attended and spoken at the London event I felt qualified to <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2011/11/reviewing-the-london-data-visualisation-marathon/\" target=\"_blank\">share my thoughts</a> on the event shortly after.</p><p>In February, Enrico published a post on his great <a href=\"http://fellinlovewithdata.com/reflections/vis-marathons\" target=\"_blank\">Fell In Love With Data</a> blog expressing his general dissatisfiaction with the outcome of the contest overall. I recommend you take a read of this post, the comments and the discussions that it triggered.</p><p>In order to get a different perspective on this contest I invited Kyle Foreman, a PhD student at Imperial College, part of the winning team at the London marathon, to share his own reflections on the event.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.visualizing.org/embedded/37074\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Background</strong></span></p><p>Iâve come to visualization in a very roundabout way. I was a psychology and neuroscience major as an undergraduate, then I did a masterâs degree and fellowship revolving around global health statistics. My job during the fellowship was to write statistical models for predicting global mortality due to specific diseases and conditions (e.g. maternal mortality and malaria). As part of that work, I dealt with a large, multi-dimensional dataset (40M+ observations, stratified by country, year, age, sex, disease, type of study). During model development, every time I made a change I would generate thousands and thousands of graphs to try to evaluate the model performance along all the different dimensions. And if in the process we identified a datapoint that was clearly wrong, we then had to go back to our 40M observations and figure out where the problem had come from.</p><p>I quickly tired of making gigantic PDF files every day, so I looked into web based visualizations and settled on Protovis. I had never done web design before, but there were plenty of tutorials and resources online to get started. I eventually built an ugly but functional application for viewing any desired slice of the dataset, mousing over to see all the related metadata for a datapoint, and displaying various model fits over the data.</p><p>It improved the workflow so much that creating similar visualization/modeling tools became a major part of my work. And although I started making visualizations out of necessity, I came to enjoy the process of making useful and attractive displays of my results as much or perhaps more than working on the underlying statistics. As such, Iâve been heavily integrating visualization dashboards into my Biostatistics PhD dissertation, and Iâve been entering various visualization contests when the underlying topic strikes my interest.</p><p>As for the other members of the team, we had never actually met before the contest. Peter and Cristina are both undergrads in Imperialâs computer science department. Peter has a lot of experience with various projects and consulting jobs heâs done, and Cristina has interned at Facebook. Fan got added to our team the morning of the competition because the other participants from his school had failed to show up. I think his major is Information Design, but he had never done any data visualization before.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>The visualization itself</strong></span></p><p>Since we hadnât met until the day of the event, we hadnât done any preparation at all. But honestly, Iâm not sure how much it wouldâve helped â without knowing what the challenge is, it wouldâve been hard to lay useful groundwork beforehand.</p><p>The first thing we did was spend an hour or so reading through the questionnaire the dataset was derived from, brainstorming ideas, and making sketches; at this point we were mostly doing this independently, aside from asking each other clarifying questions and such. The goal was just to familiarize ourselves with all the data in front of us. Then we spent some time as a group discussing what we found (potentially) interesting in the data â what would make a good story, what could be visualized in a cool way, what was hidden in the gigantic dataset, etc. We batted around a lot of ideas, settling on showing how different demographic groups had different feelings towards the Olympics.</p><p>We decided to cluster the dozens of questions into five different categories for a simple reason â so that we could use the Olympic rings motif in the final product. Honestly, the data probably more easily leant itself to 4 categories, but we stretched it to 5 because sometimes the design opportunities are just too hard to pass up. Once we had decided on that, the rest of it just sort of fell into place â a donut chart for each category, colored like the Olympic logo, with a menu for showing different demographic groups.</p><p>At this point, we sort of split up â Fan began grouping the survey questions into groups and weighting them, Peter wrote some software to derive all the necessary statistics from the dataset, Cristina worked on the chord diagram which shows relationships between different categories, and I began work on the donut charts. Once Peter and Fan prepared the data, they began helping with coding the visualizations itself.</p><p>Cristina and I worked with made up data to start, so that while Peter and Fan compiled the actual statistics we could still be productive. I think our ability to work in parallel like this is the only thing that enabled us to get everything accomplished by the next morning.</p><p>The thing that really makes everything work â the animated transitions between the donut charts and chord diagram â almost didnât come together. We had built the two pieces in parallel, so reconciling them at the end wasnât easy. I donât think we got everything glued together until about 10am. That left us with two hours, during which we decided to hack together a quick walkthrough/tutorial, which I think helped clarify to the user what they were seeing.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>The event</strong></span></p><p>I think this was the first total all-nighter I had pulled since my exams as an undergrad in 2008 â even then I would normally sneak in at least an hour or two of sleep. While it was good to see I can still work for 24 hours straight if need be, itâs not something I intend to repeat until the next Visualization Marathon. One of our teammates was about ready to fall asleep at the keyboard by about 7am and went home.</p><p>The coolest thing about the event was that the groups all had such different backgrounds. There were design students that had very little statistical background but could make the data look absolutely beautiful. Our team was more towards the technical/statistical side of things, so we definitely drew inspiration from how aesthetic some of the projects around us and displayed during the talks were.</p><p>Even within my own team, I was exposed to useful new ideas. For instance, Iâm a statistician and all my CS/web design skills Iâve just sort of picked up along the way, so I had never seen how a real web developer structures a project. Working with Peter taught me a lot about best practices for web development, which Iâve put to great use in subsequent projects.</p><p>My advice for future teams is to come up with a workplan that allows everyone to contribute, ideally in parallel. Thereâs a lot to be done and only 24 hours to do it in, so organizing yourselves such that everyone can be accomplishing something at once is crucial to success.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Re: fellinlovewithdata.comâs comments</strong></span></p><p>I totally agree that a visualization should be useful in addition to attractive. Thatâs partly a result of my background (which I rambled on about a lot up there^) â I came to visualization out of necessity as a statistician, so I would rather have a visualization that is a bit ugly but clearly communicates the data than a beautiful design that I canât make sense of.</p><p>I think a 24 hour marathon is a useful adjunct to Visualizing.orgâs (and other sitesâ) other longer term contests. Yes, you can of course do a better job visualizing something over a month than in a day. But the marathon format accomplishes other things that longer contests donât lend themselves as well to:</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

It runs from a Sunday through to a Friday every March. This year was the 20th anniversary of the event, established in recognition of the Argentinian infographic pioneer <a href=\"http://www.malofiej20.com/who-really-was-alejandro-malofiej-quien-fue-realmente-alejandro-malofiej/\" target=\"_blank\">Alejandro Malofiej</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5004\" title=\"Malofiej1\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Malofiej11-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></p><p>The event comprises three elements â the Malofiej awards judging process runs alongside the âShow, Donât Tellâ workshop and then, on Wednesday evening, the World Infographics Summit commences.</p><p>The âShow, Donât Tellâ workshop is a two-day workshop for students or young professionals to fine-tune their craft through a hands-on coaching session from some of the most esteemed information graphic experts in the field, namely John Grimwade, Juan Velasco, Geoff McGhee and Alberto Cairo. I had no involvement in the event so wonât offer any reflections other than to say if you are a budding infographics design student then you should seriously consider allowing yourself to take part in this unique experience.</p><p>The Summit involves two days of <a href=\"http://www.malofiej20.com/malofiej-world-summit-program/\" target=\"_blank\">back-to-back presentations</a> from speakers on the Jury panel and additional VIP guests covering a wide range of inspiration subjects. Others will be better placed and more strongly motivated to write a summary of the talks but I have to say, whether it was by design or by luck, the blend of topics and the variety of presentational styles was a real treat. So many inspiring people and so much to learn â in itself it is the best conference I have ever been to and it was a sincere pleasure to just share the stage with everyone else.</p><p>Â </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Golden Ticket</strong></span></p><p>Speaking from within the data visualisation field, Malofiej is an event which perhaps doesnât quite pop-up on everyoneâs radar. It really depends on the specific subject circles you find yourself operating within.</p><p>My awareness of the event was achieved through exposure to people like Gert Neilsen and Chiqui Esteban. A further layer of interest came from witnessing the diverse strands of reaction to the best in show award achieved by Amanda Cox/New York Times with the â<a href=\"http://visualjournalism.com/new-york-times-sweeps-the-malofiej-awards/2009/03/28/\">Ebb and Flow of box office takings</a>â back in 2009.</p><p>I would concede I havenât been immersed in the history of Malofiej or felt a particular sense of belonging to the very specialist world of information graphics. However, when I received the âgolden ticketâ invitation from Javier Errea, the eventâs principle organiser and figurehead, I was fully aware of the gravity of the event and the great privilege it was to have been asked to attend, speak and fulfil the role of jury member.</p><p>Â </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Jury Duty</strong></span></p><p>The judging and presentation of the Malofiej awards is the eventâs raison dâetre. During the leading weeks and months a call is issued throughout the worldâs newspaper and magazine industry for infographic submissions covering all sizes of organization and all sections of their publications. For a small fee these pieces are entered, collated and organized under a wide range of category headings for the judging panel to evaluate and establish the medal-worthy entrants.</p><p>The jury is made up of experts and celebrated practitioners from a range of disciplines in or around the infographics industry. Aside from the prestige and profile of the anniversary event, this yearâs jury was particular notable for its diversity and Javier explained this was a continued attempt to keep the jury as representative of the intersecting subject areas as possible. This would ensure the variety of perspectives and opinions are as rich as possible as the world surrounding infographic design evolves.</p><p>Joining me on this yearâs jury was Anne Gerdes, Nigel Holmes, Andrew Vande Moere, Robert Kosara, Moritz Stefaner, Sheila Pontis, Ginny Mason, Bryan Christie, Carl DeTorres, Sergio PeÃ§anha, Matthew Bloch, Mario TancÃ³n and Gonzalo Peltzer. You can read each personâs short biographies on the <a href=\"http://www.malofiej20.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/malofiej20_programa_ONLINE.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Malofiej poster</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5005\" title=\"Malofiej4\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Malofiej4-337x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"337\" height=\"450\"></p><p>The process of judging commences on Sunday at 9am and runs through to Wednesday lunch time. That is the fixed start and end point but the commitment of hours spent judging in between these points is dictated by the progress of assessment. When you are faced with 1,513 entries split between static (about 1200) and online submissions this means most evenings finished around 8pm. It is an especially intense and demanding process. You donât just simply âget throughâ the volume of entries, you take the weight of responsibility that comes with judging any contest very seriously. You also identify strongly with each and every entrant, appreciating the demands and hurdles they would have gone through.</p><p>As I was on the static panel Iâll just talk about the process of judging for that side of things but I want to share a scene which captures the rather lonely isolation that comes with having to judging nearly 300 online entries (in this case Moritz and Andrew captured hard at work):</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5006\" title=\"Malofiej3\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Malofiej3-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></p><p>Â </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>âFish and Chipsâ</strong></span></p><p>The first round involves elimination. Each jury works independently to assess each submission and decide if it is of sufficient quality to go to the second round and potentially be considered for a medal. If you donât think the piece is worthy of going through you drop a small chip/token into a slit on the underneath of an upturned plastic cup. This process gave rise to the term âfish and chipsâ. This approach allows the voting progress to be hidden and the independence of opinion is maintained. No talking or discussions are allowed and the student volunteers â whose dedication, kindness, professionalism and warmth were a wonderful added ingredient to the week â are quick to politely reprimand those who stray!</p><p>With ten members of the static panel, any pieces that received five or more votes were excluded. The exception was if there were any categories for which jury members may have a conflict of interest (ie. their publication or even their work submitted). In these cases they would be asked to leave the area and the voting threshold would be modified accordingly.</p><p>I donât know the individual statistics but I believe around 75% of entries from round 1 were eliminated. Due to the time available and the volume required to judge it is admittedly quite an instinctive process â you canât afford to spend too much time immersing yourself in a single piece. Thatâs just the way it is. Sometimes it is quick and easy, most times it is less so. You also have to remain open and fresh to the judgment of repeated graphic subjects, although that doesnât mean you donât occasionally find the same faces just too much to bear time and time again!</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5007\" title=\"Malofiej5\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Malofiej5-337x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"337\" height=\"450\"></p><p>The second round switches the voting on its head. This time you drop in a chip if you believe it is worthy of a medal. Once again a similar threshold is applied and after each category is completed, those that go through to a third round are immediately considered for a medal.</p><p>Round three is the first occasion where discussion, debate and opinion exchange are allowed and encouraged. It is here where you tap into the richness of knowledge and perspective from the varied judging panel. Opinions are refined, a more considered assessment of each piece is possible and, at the end, a show-of-hands voting count is undertaken to establish the medal awarded.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5008\" title=\"Malofiej6\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Malofiej6-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></p><p>Â </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Awards</strong></span></p><p>A really detailed and helpful account of the gold-winning entries are presented by <a href=\"http://www.snd.org/2012/03/malofiej-20-winners-the-jury-talks-about-the-gold-medal-work/\" target=\"_blank\">Jonathon Berlin on the SND website</a> so I wonât go into the winners nor the reasons for their awards. There is also a full list of all medallist entries on the <a href=\"http://www.malofiej20.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/M20-Awards-Premios2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Malofiej site</a>.</p><p>What I want to focus on instead is something that is really important for those reading who may have had an entry judged.</p><p>Firstly, no jury member who represents an organization whose piece is being judged takes part in any part of the voting nor even in the discussions. They are banished to a far-off corner of Pamplona and only summoned back when their input is independent.</p><p>Secondly, to achieve any sort of medal is a significant, noteworthy achievement. To secure a bronze, you need to obtain 70% of the judging vote to agree on its quality. A silver medal requires 80% and a gold 90% agreement. For any designer to pick up any medal is fantastic and there should be no sense whatsoever that anything less than a gold is a failure â a bronze or a silver medal represents a wonderful outcome and recipients should be really proud of themselves.</p><p>Â </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Firing Squad</strong></span></p><p>The presentation of the winning pieces to the Summitâs delegates was perhaps the least comfortable part of the week. We were invited to announce the gold medals and best in show winners and use the platform to express the reasoning behind our selections. I have to say it was delivered in a less than satisfactory way, perhaps too organic and unstructured, and there just seemed to be an underwhelming reaction to our selections. It did feel like we were in front of a firing squad whose weapon of choice was indifferent silence.</p><p>The reason for this appears to be the continued dominance of the New York Times and, to a lesser extent, National Geographic. Focusing on the New York Times, the basic fact is this: they are the best in the business and continue to be.</p><p>Organisations must recognize that it is much harder to get to the top than it is to stay there. Once you have a winning formula, that is exactly what you have, so you stick to it. Unlocking the secrets to that formula is they key. Future success at Malofiej isnât about other organisations copying what the NYT do, it is about emulating them. It is about learning what it is about their design editorial approach, the restraint and elegance of their visual identity, the commitment to journalistic clarity, the courage to deploy graphics across generous and treasured page space and, of course, the technical ability to churn these things out at an incredible rate. Forget how many people they have at their disposal and focus on the stream of quality these people are responsible for.</p><p>Additionally, one must remember that Gold is not the only currency in town. As I have said above, the achievements of those many oragnisations and individuals who secured silver and bronze medals is a wonderful outcome. It is just a shame that the focus on this presentation session is on just the individual gold medalists. I would suggest, as many others expressed independently afterwards, that we need to celebrate the achievements of these winners more openly than we currently do. The presentation session should begin with an acknowledgement of the variety of style, projects and organisations who have secured these awards so that the tip of the iceberg that is the gold medal winners doesnât seem so narrow. I think that was the main issue at the root of the muted response.</p><p>What I cannot accept is any accusation that the jury just arrive, go through the motions, and then succumb to the big name designers and big name oragnisations. That is simply not the case. The integrity and quality of the individuals on that panel simply could never let that happen. It is an intensely thought over and fought over process, one which arrives at a carefully considered and crafted set of results which everyone on that panel will stand by.</p><p>Â </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Final Reflections</strong></span></p><p>In my introduction I described this event as the best week of professional life. That sounds quite a lofty statement but I canât think of any sequence of my career that has resulted in so much fun, so much inspiration, so much reward and so many new friends and contacts.</p><p>The group of people involved in the jury, especially, was a frankly brilliant collection of people: uniquely gifted, intelligent, humble, funny and unwaveringly more interested in other people than themselves. I hope this is a shared view across the team but I felt we gelled wonderfully well, the camaraderie was excellent, and everyoneâs opinion was valued and treated with equal weight throughout.</p><p>Sheila Pontis (aka âLa Presidentaâ) was given the unenviable role of jury president and was a constant binding and leading force from the minute we started to the final presentation of awards at the Friday closing dinner. As an English and Spanish speaker she was absolutely key to the smooth operation of the weekâs activities and everyone was so appreciative of the personal contribution Sheila made to Malofiej 20.</p><p>I could go on and on about the strength of bond within this team and pick out some highlights of my impressions from each person on the jury, but I wonât â besides I think <a href=\"http://bryanchristieblog.blogspot.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Bryan Christie</a> will be doing this so check his blog for updates. All I will say that I truly hope and believe we will stay friends for many years to come.</p><p>If you find yourself in the position I was last week you will be a very lucky person indeed. And, Javier, if you are reading this far down, please consider me ready and available for any future Malofiej event â thank you.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5009\" title=\"Malofiej7\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Malofiej7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></p><p>Â </p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

Well, time has sped by and on Saturday I will be flying over to Pamplona to kick off this prestigious week long event â as <a href=\"http://eagereyes.org/blog/2012/upcoming-travel-sxsw-malofiej\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Kosara put it</a>, the Pulitzer Prize of Information Graphics.<br>\nYouâll see the fabulous array of speakers by clicking on the image below to access the main eventâs programme of talks and presentations. Iâm really looking forward to meeting in person many of the heroes and heroines of the visualisation and information graphics field.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.malofiej20.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/malofiej20_programa_ONLINE.pdf\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4981\" title=\"MalofiejProg\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MalofiejProg-600x357.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"357\"></a></p><p>The title of my own talk will be âShowcase of data visualisation techniques for thriving in the age of Big Dataâ and this is an abstract of what Iâll be covering and why:</p><p>In this era of Big Data, with the recording, storage and access to vast quantities of data increasing at such an incredible rate, the opportunity for newspapers and other media organisations to extract key insight and unlock the stories contained within also increases. Facilitating such enlightenment is the objective of data visualisation. In this presentation we will be showcasing some of the best contemporary visualisation projects from prominent designers across the globe, with a focus on identifying the most effective techniques, methods and resources being used today.</p><p>During the course of the week I will be trying to keep a frequent update of insights, discoveries and thoughts emerging from this event. I may even try experiment with some live blogging during the talks, but weâll see how that idea developsâ¦</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Big Data Con</span></strong></p><p>As well as Malofiej, in the next few weeks I will be giving a similar talk at the <a href=\"http://bigdatacon.de/2012/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Data Con event</a> in Mainz, Germany. It sounds a really good event but due to commitments either side of the day on which I am speaking (17th April) I will be jetting in and back out of Frankfurt within the day and so will not be able to get the most value out of the great set of speakers and topics.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">General Site News</span></strong></p><p>Updates and blogging frequency has been patchy over the past few weeks as my schedule has been jam packed. It is very frustrating because there has been so much good content, new projects and general developments to base posts around. Apart from the Malofiej posts there will likely be continued irregularity to my posting through to April. However, from mid-April onwards a number of factors in my currently rather hectic life will clear up and you will start to see much more prolific activity. I am also going to be working hard during the Spring/Summer months to put into place a brand new site design which will breathe even more life into things.

On December 15th 2010 a former colleague, Matt, passed away after a prolonged battle with an exceptionally rare form of cancer. Aged only 31 he had barely begun living his life and his best years were ahead.</p><p>On May 5th I will be joining a group of Mattâs former colleagues and undertaking the <a href=\"http://www.thethreepeakschallenge.co.uk/yorkshire-three-peaks-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\">Yorkshire Three Peaks challenge</a>, a walking event that involves scaling the peaks of Pen-y-ghent, Whernside and Ingleborough, covering a 24.5 miles distance in under 12 hours.

At the time the most intriguing footnote to this launch was the promised release of an automated, infographic creation tool which was scheduled for late 2011. Thereâs been a bit of a delay but today sees the launch of <a href=\"http://blog.visual.ly/infographic-creation-made-easy-with-visual-ly-create/\" target=\"_blank\">Visual.ly Create</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://blog.visual.ly/infographic-creation-made-easy-with-visual-ly-create/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4976\" title=\"visually_create\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/visually_create.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"504\"></a></p><p>The people behind Visual.ly have tapped into their collective years of experience in developing infographic designs and attempted to integrate the best practices of data visualisation design into a step-by-step process which unleashes the visual potential of your desired data feed:</p><p>â¦weâve built data feeds into a number of infographic designs, created for you by our team of expert designers. Making an infographic, based on your own data, couldnât be easier. Simply connect and click to produce a professional-looking infographic.

Iâve not had chance to play with the tool yet so canât yet provide any narrative or judgments about its value or effectiveness. There is still a huge appetite for infographics across great swathes of the online population so Iâm sure it will prove to be a popular development amongst that demographic. Moreover, it will be interesting to see how the toolâs capabilities evolve over time.</p><p>â¦this is just the beginning. Visual.ly Create will grow over time to include additional data feeds, designs, stories, and themes in the areas of sports, politics, economics, food, and more. Weâll even be opening it up to the community, so that you can create your own designs and themes. Thatâs when things get interesting.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

Starting from an initial concept design, anyone is able to take the development forward by modifying and enhancing the code in all sorts of different directions, whether large or small (eg. colour scheme, encoding choice etc.).Â Eventually the design will evolve into a finished collaborative visualisation.Â As well as contributing to design changes the community can also participate through voting, evaluating and discussing what changes have worked or otherwise.</p><p>The first project involves a dataset fromÂ <a href=\"http://www.visualizing.org/sprint/global-water-experiment\" target=\"_blank\">Global Water Experiment </a>involving over 75,000 students in 80 countries collecting and recording water quality samples from their neighbourhoods.

We hope that it will encourage many budding data journalists to look at data as a source and give them courage to tackle it, as well as showcasing some great examples of journalism using data as inspiration for future stories.</p><p>In terms of contents, after its <a href=\"http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/introduction.html\" target=\"_blank\">introduction</a>, the book covers <a href=\"http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/in_the_newsroom.html\" target=\"_blank\">life in the newsroom</a>, a series of <a href=\"http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/case_studies.html\" target=\"_blank\">data journalism case studies</a>, and then three chapters dedicated to the challenges of data: <a href=\"http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/getting_data.html\" target=\"_blank\">getting it</a>, <a href=\"http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data.html\" target=\"_blank\">understanding it</a> and <a href=\"http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/delivering_data.html\" target=\"_blank\">delivering it</a>.Â For those of us with a specific data visualisation slant, it is the last chapter which has most direct relevance and these are the sections covered within:</p><p>A free web version of the book can beÂ <a href=\"http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/\" target=\"_blank\">viewed here</a>. Alternatively, if you wish to pay for anÂ <a href=\"http://oreil.ly/ddj-e-print%20\" target=\"_blank\">e- or print version</a>Â from OâReilly Media, you can pre-order now and just wait a few more weeks for it.</p><p>Many congratulations to the project coordinators <a href=\"https://ja.twitter.com/#!/bb_liliana\" target=\"_blank\">Liliana</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/lucyfedia\" target=\"_blank\">Lucy</a> who have worked incredibly hard, alongside others too many to list, to get this project across the finishing line.

In the meantime, Bristol will be the closest alternative for those desperate for the knowledge!</p><p>Elsewhere, the other courses that are close to filling are <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training-workshop-nyc1\">New York City</a> (with four places remaining) and <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training-workshop-wdc1\">Washington DC</a> (with six).

I will keep you posted on any updates regarding this. I am also exploring ways of possibly doing video tutorials to reach those people in far off lands! However, this is a secondary priority to continuing with the existing introductory course and developing the additional ones.</p><p>Â <br><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Private Events</strong></span></p><p>I have had a number of enquiries about designing and delivering private training courses. I have done and will be doing training sessions for some extremely prominent organisations, details of which I will share at a later date for confidentiality reasons. If your organisation would be interested in having a private session arranged on your site just let me know via <a href=\"mailto:andy@visualisingdata.com\">email</a> and weâll look at the options to suit your needs.</p><p>Â <br><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Data Stories Podcast</strong></span></p><p>Finally, if you want to hear more about these training courses I am lined up to join Enrico and Moritz on the award-worthy <a href=\"http://datastori.es/\" target=\"_blank\">Data Stories</a> podcast, due in the next week or two.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>The issue of plagiarism vs. inspiration is not a new topic, it has been with us for years and is the fundamental basis of copyright and IP, but it is an increasingly important consideration for us in the visualisation field. </p><p>This came up at my data visualisation training event in Washington DC last week. Iâm not going to focus on the specific case that was being discussed because I donât want to put the attention unnecessarily on the person in question but I think it is an issue worth exploring and discussing, because Iâm not sure what the right call is.</p><p>Recently, Alberto Cairo wrote a <a href=\"http://visualopolis.com/en/component/content/article/54-featured/121-infographicsplagiarism.html\" target=\"_blank\">great piece</a> about this matter in relation to an information graphic published in the newspaper âO Estado De S.Pauloâ and then allegedly copied a few days later and published in âLa Stampaâ.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://visualopolis.com/en/component/content/article/54-featured/121-infographicsplagiarism.html\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5301\" title=\"Plagiarism\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Plagiarism-600x388.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\"></a></p><p>In information graphics, with its greater scope for inclusion of illustrations and non-visualisation elements, there is arguably a broader range of potential creative solutions than there are with visualisation. So when you see the same thing twice, there is something more inherently blatant, especially when there are no acknowledgements, as in the example below where the New York Timeâs piece is almost exactly repeated in the Danish <a href=\"http://www.b.dk/globalt/den-store-oversigt-over-eurokrisen\" target=\"_blank\">Berlingske</a> publication.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/10/23/sunday-review/an-overview-of-the-euro-crisis.htm\"><img src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Plagiarism2-509x450.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Plagiarism2\" width=\"509\" height=\"450\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5302\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.b.dk/globalt/den-store-oversigt-over-eurokrisen\"><img src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Plagiarism3-600x356.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Plagiarism3\" width=\"600\" height=\"356\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5303\"></a></p><p>Furthermore, during the judging process at <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/03/personal-reflections-on-malofiej-20/\" target=\"_blank\">Malofiej 20</a>, there were a number of examples where you could clearly see a large amount of design reference to other pieces (some present in the awards contest, others not) but without any acknowledgement. Some, like the above were almost straight copies and only with the intervention of those who had seen previous, similar works were we able to root out the offending pieces from the medal reckoning.</p><p>Returning specifically to data visualisation. As new and innovative ways of representing data are conceived and as the field expands more and more in terms of participation, there will naturally be a great deal of inspiration going on. As people see new methods being adopted, allowing them an escape route away from the ubiquity of the bar and pie charts, there is a risk that some of this inspiration could be perceived as plagiarism. </p><p>The first thing, of course, is to consider including an acknowledgement and this will largely take the sting out of any potential situation and may even be seen be the originator of that method as a positive recognition.</p><p>But for how long should we need to maintain these acknowledgements? Where is the line drawn after which it is fine to just go ahead and pursue a method that was once rare but now is increasingly common? </p><p>Letâs take an extreme example. It is generally accepted that William Playfair was the first to conceive and utilise the bar chart, but how many of us acknowledge Playfair in our work whenever we use the dashboard. None of us, of course we donât. </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Playfair_Barchart.gif/500px-Playfair_Barchart.gif\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Playfair_Barchart.gif/500px-Playfair_Barchart.gif\" class=\"alignnone\" width=\"500\" height=\"338\"></a></p><p>Yet, if I churned out a piece today that drew inspiration from the <a href=\"http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/\" target=\"_blank\">OECD Better Life Indexâs</a> floral design, a work that has only been around for the past year, I would and should acknowledge those who were behind it. </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Plagiarism4-600x399.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Plagiarism4\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5305\"></a></p><p>But what about those in-between? The <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/\" target=\"_blank\">Treemap</a>? The <a href=\"http://www.leebyron.com/else/streamgraph/\" target=\"_blank\">Streamgraph</a>? </p><p>What are the most appropriate and sustainable guidelines for this particular branch of design ethics that we can all agree on and practice. Let me know your thoughts in the comments belowâ¦</p>",

    "content": "<p>Hello everyone. I felt compelled to break the silence with a brief update on matters. Iâve had quite a lot of traffic round these parts of late, thanks to sharing of my <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/04/the-data-journalism-handbook-is-now-live/\" target=\"_blank\">data journalism handbook post</a> and Nathanâs inclusion of my site on his <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2012/04/27/data-and-visualization-blogs-worth-following/\" target=\"_blank\">collection of blog reads</a>, but by now people are probably wondering why the lights are on but thereâs seemingly nobody home!</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://mysoundwhen.com/img/010.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5249\" title=\"Tumbleweed\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Tumbleweed-600x450.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></a></p><p>Â <br><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Packed Training Schedule</strong></span><br>\nOne of the main reason for my current dry blog post spell is that Iâm firmly in the midst of my packed <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training/\" target=\"_blank\">training schedule</a>. Iâve had a few private events lately and tomorrow I fly over to New York to begin a three date tour in <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training-workshop-nyc1\" target=\"_blank\">NYC</a>, <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training-workshop-wdc1\" target=\"_blank\">DC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training-workshop-bal1\" target=\"_blank\">Baltimore</a>. When I return Iâm on a 2 week Italian holiday and then back over to <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training-workshop-chi1\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago</a> and <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training-workshop-tor1\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto</a> for another chunk of time. This means my posting frequency has been and might continue to be somewhat sporadic for the near future but once the middle of June arrives, the acceleration will beÂ significant.</p><p>Iâve had a number of people starting to ask when Iâll be arranging and announcing my <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training/\" target=\"_blank\">training schedule</a>Â for the latter half of 2012/start of 2013. Well, the simple answer is Iâve not had time to think about it but I will be doing a formal call out for suggested locations soon. In the meantime, just drop me anÂ <a href=\"mailto:andy@visualisingdata.com\">email</a>Â with yourÂ preferredÂ location and Iâll throw it into the mix!<br>\nÂ <br><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Upcoming posts</strong></span><br>\nIâve got so many half-finished/half-started blog posts in my draft folder it is becoming quite incompetent, especially as for many of the subjects the moment has somewhat passed, but I hope to rattle off a few key posts over the next month or so:</p><p>Â <br><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Visualing Data: The Reboot</strong></span><br>\nOnce June is out of the way I have loads of plans for a bit of a Visualising Data reboot which will see the site being stripped back and rebuilt brick by brick. Iâm going to be looking at a new look, a new feel and definitely an enhanced approach to the content side of things too. If you have any deep felt opinions about what the site should and/or shouldnât be, feel free to get in touch viaÂ <a href=\"mailto:andy@visualisingdata.com\">email</a>Â - I canât guarantee it will turn out as you suggest but happy to receive any informed opinions.<br>\nÂ <br><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Book</strong></span><br>\nLast, but not least, Iâm currently also very occupied with writing my first book. As you may have heard on the recent <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/04/data-stories-podcast-episode-5-another-appearance/\" target=\"_blank\">Data Stories podcast</a> I am in the middle of working hard on an e-book which will be published later in the year. I wonât share any further details at this stage but watch out for further announcements in due course. I will, however, share news that this isnât the only book Iâm working onâ¦</p><p>Anyway, enough self-promotion for now, just thought Iâd let you know whatâs going down at Visualising Data HQ.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Last week I posted a <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/06/talk-slides-the-8-hats-of-data-visualisation/\" target=\"_blank\">slideshare version</a> of my slides from a recent pair of presentation events in Chicago. The title of this talk was âThe 8 hats of data visualisationâ. In this article I want to follow up these slides with a written accompaniment to contextualise and explain what I was presenting, as slides alone donât really manage to achieve this effectively.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5525\" title=\"8HatsTitle\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/8HatsTitle-600x148.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"148\"></p><p>Ever since I discovered data visualisation I have been intrigued by the many different subject areas and disciplines that contribute to its unique mix of art and science. This convergence of different ingredients introduces a wonderful richness and variety of concerns but can equally present quite a challenge for people looking to master the subject.</p><p>As the field continues to increase in popularity and exposure, penetrating more into the mainstream, and as data resources and technological capabilities continue to enhance at incredible rates, the opportunities and challenges similarly increase.Â For many, the prospect of trying to acquire and effectively demonstrate sufficient knowledge and skill across the board of requirements is something that can be either intimidating or at least exist as a perceptual barrier. There is a sense that to be successful you need to be a Superman or Wonder Woman?!</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5567\" title=\"SupermanWonderwoman\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SupermanWonderwoman-600x450.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\"></p><p>During myÂ <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training/\" target=\"_blank\">training courses</a>Â I have met many people who have expressed a similar concern. More specifically, they donât know where they fit in to the world of data visualisation. They arenât trained designers, they arenât skilled technologists, so how can they contribute to the design process?</p><p>Typically I find these people to be extremely bright, sharpÂ individualsÂ with a keen sense of the analytical dimensions that might be most interesting to surface in a visualisation. They might also be great organisers, leaders and be able to pull a team of people together to create a solution. The key point here is that everybody can find a role, even if they are not capable in certain areas because collaboration with others who can plug such gaps is so much more feasible these days. There are plenty of other duties required that donât have such technical capabilities or experiences.</p><p>Furthermore, we should assess more closely the role of technology in data visualisation. IâveÂ <a href=\"http://knight.stanford.edu/work-fellow/2012/times-editor-says-media-not-driven-to-data-journalism/\" target=\"_blank\">somewhat paraphrased</a>Â or maybe just echoed Aron Pilhofer (of the New York Times), but doing data visualisation well is âless a technology problem,Â more a people problemâ. So, if you donât have the tech skills but have the people skills â there is a role for you. Similarly, if you do have the tech skills, you need to ensure you also have the people skills.</p><p>Having spent a number of years assessing and learning about effective visualisation design I was interested to take a specific analytical look at the range of different capabilities required to ensure that any project is undertaken in the most rounded sense. These can be roles fulfilled by a number of people or they can be the different, deliberate mindsets of an individual to ensure that the problem is viewed and tackled from all necessary directions and not from a limited perspective. This is where I came up with the 8 hats of data visualisation design.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5528\" title=\"8HatsImages\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/8HatsImages-600x303.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"303\"></p><p>A couple of things that motivated the concept of the 8 hats.</p><p>Firstly, and obviously, was <a href=\"http://www.debonogroup.com/six_thinking_hats.php%20\" target=\"_blank\">Edward de Bonoâs 6 thinking hats</a>, which essentially relates to the different thinking perspectives we should try to occupy when trying to reason and solve with complex problems.</p><p>Secondly, and far less obviously, I remebered a cartoon I used to watch as a kid (and probably only UK people will recognise) called <a href=\"http://realtimeshortstories.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/mr_benn.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Mr Benn</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/FMSJNrzQ3PM\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\"></iframe></p><p>The basic narrative of the story was that, in each episode, Mr Benn would go into a fancy-dress shop, try on a particular outfit and then would enter through a secret door in the dressing room into a magical world and live out an adventure appropriate to the costume.</p><p>So, this idea of taking on different characters or different characteristics resonated with my intentions for these 8 hats. It is not meant to be scientific, it is based on an instinctive sense of what is important. Furthermore, it is not presented in a way which gives any weight or hierarchy, rather a collection of the issues and duties that need covering off.</p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5533\" title=\"Initiator\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Initiator.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"88\"></p><p>The initiator will also identify and set out some of the key parametersÂ surroundingÂ the project such as the clarity and definition of the brief, the intended format/platform of the solution, the nature of the audience (size, type) and an initial view on the proposed resolution of the data solution (headlines, full details).</p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5546\" title=\"DataScientist\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/DataScientist.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"88\"></p><p>The data scientist will also hold the key statistical knowledge to understand the most appropriate techniques and mathematical methods. They will apply this to undertake the initialÂ descriptive analysis of the data, to commence the familiarisation process of this raw material. They will also begin to undertake exploratoryÂ visual analysis to learn about the patterns, relationships and physical properties of the data.</p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5549\" title=\"Journalist\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Journalist.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"87\"></p><p>As with any research process, the approach may be inductive or deductive, but either way, the journalist is at the heart of the action, seeking to find the answers to move the project on from the preparatory/groundworkÂ activityÂ and on to its design stage.</p><p>As Edward Tufte says, âGood content reasonersÂ and presenters are rare,Â designers are notâ. That is the responsibility of the Journalist.</p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5551\" title=\"ComputerScientist\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ComputerScientist.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"88\"></p><p>Alternatively, the final technical solution may not be an innovative interactive online work but instead an infographic or static poster display, in which case technical skills with illustration packages like Adobe Illustrator will be all-important.</p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5553\" title=\"Designer\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Designer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"88\"></p><p>Their key responsibility is also to be capable of ensuring the harmony of the solution between its form and its function, ensuring it is aesthetically appealing to draw in the reader whilst fundamentally delivering the intended, communicated message.</p><p>Acting almost like a film director, they have many competing decisions to make, particularly around managingÂ the five key layers of any visualisationâs anatomy: data representation, colour and background, layout and arrangement, animation or interaction options and the annotation layer.</p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5555\" title=\"CognitiveScientist\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CognitiveScientist.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"88\"></p><p>They also can inform the design process in relation to the complexities of how the mind works in terms of memory, attention, decision-making and behavioural change.</p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5557\" title=\"Communicator\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Communicator.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"88\"></p><p>They need to be close to all stages of the process, understanding requirements, appreciating restrictions, recognising possibilities and then ultimately launching, publicising and showcasing the final work.</p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5559\" title=\"ProjectManager\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ProjectManager.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"88\"></p><p>Ultimately, this role or mindset is required to ensure things get finished, they need an eye for detail, the commitment and patience to check everything and should also be concerned with integrity matters like visualisation/statistical ethics.</p><p>If we take a look at how the relevance of these mindsets and duties surfaces at different points of a typicalÂ visualisationÂ design process, we can see the importance of being able to manage your focus and perspective according to the stage of your progress.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HatsProcess.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5571\" title=\"Hats&amp;Process\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/HatsProcess-600x444.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"444\"></a></p><p>Too often we see examples of work where there has been an immediate rush to produce a pre-conceived design or an excitable technical solution without all the preparatory work undertaken beforehand and the discipline to treat the project with the thoroughness of thought required.</p><p>Similarly, we see plenty of works that look like they could have been capable of providing really fascinating insights. They ask the right questions and seemingly tell the right stories but the technical execution, whether through an interactive design or illustration, is ultimately flawed and undermines the whole piece.</p><p>You could easily argue about some of the labels and descriptions of how the mindsets and duties have been carved up and allocated but hopefully you will be able to appreciate the many varied responsibilities that anyone delivering a data visualisation solution needs to demonstrate, regardless of whether this is an individual or collaborative design process.</p><p>Finally, it will help you recognise where you fit it in to the spectrum of duties and responsibilities, helping you identify your strengths and your weaknesses accordingly. You may then choose to address these weaknesses personally or plug the gaps with support from others.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/FullList.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5570\" title=\"FullList\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/FullList-600x448.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"448\"></a></p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Last Friday I posted my new data visualisation project titled â<a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/07/new-visualisation-design-project-the-pursuit-of-faster/\" target=\"_blank\">The Pursuit of Faster</a>â. This was a project submitted for the Visualizing.org <a href=\"http://www.visualizing.org/full-screen/41340/embedlaunch\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics contest</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.visualizing.org/embedded/41340\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p><p>This visualisation project explores the evolution of male and female medal winning performances across all Olympic Games since 1896. It portrays the patterns of improvements in the results of time-based events where speed is the measure of success, whether it be on foot (track athletics), in water (swimming) or on water (rowing and canoeing). By choosing a sport and selecting an event you can see how Gold, Silver and Bronze winning times have changed over the years, for both men and women, as they strive for that ultimate pursuit of being faster than the rest.</p><p>In this follow-up post I wanted to explain more about the design process and decisions behind this project.</p><p>The background to the project is framed by the contest and the opportunity to collaborate with a good friend of mine, Andrew Witherley, who is a skilled programmer and somebody with whom I have worked for a number of years in the past. Weâve been looking for an opportunity to work on a piece together in a non-client environment and so this was ideal.</p><p>The contestâs <a href=\"http://visualizing.org/contests/visualizing-london-2012-olympic-games\" target=\"_blank\">brief</a> was very open â â<em>We challenge you to use data and design to visualize the Olympics, helping us understand and enjoy as we watch</em>â â and so this gave us a blank canvas to decide on the data story we wished to focus on.</p><p>There were a number of ideas flying around but one of the most fascinating (and achievable) directions surrounded the curiosity of how much faster people are these days compared to athletes down the years. How have enhancements in coaching, technology, sports science, training and physique influenced the improvement in performances?</p><p>And so the initial purpose of this project was to create an elegant, exploratory interface that allows users to learn about how medal results for different speed-based Olympic sporting events have improved across every summer games in which they have been held.</p><p>In terms of the influencing parameters surrounding the project, the main factor was the timescales for the contest. Whilst it was open for about 5 weeks, we really only had chance to work on things for the latter two weeks and even then it was rather irregular. The intended target audience would really be anyone with an interest in the Olympics but specifically those with a more analytical slant looking to learn something new rather than just digesting eye-candy â after all the Games would be (and has been) flooded with so many visualisation and infographics pieces.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Acquisition</strong></span> â With a clear idea of what we required, the best source of athlete, result and event based data was found on the excellent <a href=\"http://www.databaseolympics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">databaseOlympics</a>, which has huge repository of data for all Olympic Games from 1896 to 2008.Â To extract the data we imported it from the source URL using Google Spreadsheet and the formula â=ImportHtml(âhttp://www.databaseolympics.com/games/gamessport.htm?g=47&amp;sp=ATHâ; âtableâ;0)â, repeating for each year and sport.</p><p>We extracted data for all sports that involved time-based measurements for the results, rather than those that are based on points, distance measurements or tournament style contests. This narrowed down the sports to: <em>Track Athletics</em>, <em>Canoeing</em>, <em>Cycling</em>, <em>Rowing</em>, <em>Swimming</em> and <em>Triathlon</em>.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Examination</strong></span> â An inspection of the data revealed a few issues that we would have to deal with early. The different sports and the events within each sport have changed over the years so there were some inconsistent datasets. We decided to eliminate any event that wasnât held in 2008 and those that have been held fewer than on three occasions (as there wouldnât be much comparable data to work with).</p><p>Also, there were pockets of records for which no results were recorded or the results were estimated and a few that seemedÂ questionableÂ in accuracy (perhaps input errors of wrong times or years).Â Another issue was the challenge of handling time data (especially formats) which always seems to bring so much baggage with it as it moves from Â one tool to the next. This was particularly a problem with the problem of dealing with the date 1896 in Excel and Tableau (I understand this <em>can</em> be resolved but it did cause a problem initially). A further problem, which materialised too late to undo, was the failure of Googleâs Spreadsheet import routine to cope with non-standard text characters such asÂ Ã¡ orÂ Ã¶ in many athletes names.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Transforming Data</strong></span>Â â a certain amount of data cleaning was undertaken to resolve some of the quality issues identified above, except for, at this stage, the athlete name problems (which affected 400+ records) â due to the time restrictions it was decided that this would be tackled later if possible.</p><p>Further transformation was undertaken to put the data into shape fit for analysis and fit for connection to the web. This included forming a calculated field of the result time in seconds to facilitate the creation of an âindexâ which would reveal the % improvements across an event based on changes compared to the slowest result. This index therefore enabled comparison within and between events and sports. Team-based events (with multiple medal winners) were combined in to a single record.</p><p>After all the data treatment we were left with just four sports: Athletics, Canoeing, Rowing and Swimming.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Consolidation</strong></span> â We decided not to acquire any other data but we did seek to consolidate our raw material with a bank of images for country flags and event posters, which would be intended for use in the final design.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Visual Analysis</strong></span> â This was conducted using Tableau to familiarise with the range and distribution of values for each event/sport, understand design factors such as axis parameters, learn about which events were for both genders/just one and generally learn about the data in a more visual setting.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5940\" title=\"EventsbyGender\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/EventsbyGender.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"190\"></p><p>There were a few curious results (such as the menâs 3000m Steeplechase) which, after investigation, were down to inconsistent distances being run in some of the earliest events. The most confusing data surrounded some of the Canoeing events which revealed time inconsistencies around the 2000 Sydney games (much slower) but there were no apparent answers for this so we decided to leave them unchanged.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5945\" title=\"VisualAnalysis\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/VisualAnalysis.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"252\"></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5946\" title=\"VisualAnalysis2\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/VisualAnalysis2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"343\" height=\"360\"></p><p>We were now very clear about the physical properties of the data we had to work and an early concept for how each variable would be deployed was soon apparent: <em>Year</em> (axis), <em>Country</em> (for analysis and detail for annotation), <em>Sport</em> (selection), <em>Event</em> (selection), <em>Gender</em> (filter), <em>Athlete</em> (detail for annotation), <em>Result Time</em> (axis, detail for annotation), <em>Medal</em> (data marker, series, filter).</p><p>There were several different ways of slicing our analysis and visualising the data on this subject so we needed to demonstrate a clear editorial focus. Some of the best visualisations are based on the type of questions that might pop up in a pub conversation between friends.</p><p>We wanted to create an exploratory tool that allowed users to pursue queries such as â<em>I wonder how much faster the 100M medallists are now compared to the past?</em>â and be able to find out further information about all the relevant events, how the patterns compare for the different medals, what % improvement in time has been experienced, which events have improved the most and the least, who were the athletes who won the medals etc.</p><p>Additionally, we wanted to facilitate comparison between the progress of men and women: is one improving more than the other? Whilst we knew from the data that women were slower compared to men across the events, were they showing evidence of getting closer to men in any event?</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Data representation</strong></span> -Â The data representation was intentionally straightforward, presented using the visual variable of position on a common scale to maximise the clarity of the visualisation. The markers would resemble medals (albeit transparent) and coloured accordingly, then each point would be joined into a line chart to show the pattern and progress of improvement. Below are a couple of the early concept sketches.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5948\" title=\"Version0\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Version0.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"482\"></p><p>The x-axis would be the years of the Olympics games and the vertical y-axis would be the result times. The main decision made here involved the plotting of smaller values towards the top. Whilst this is counter-intuitive for most displays of line charts, actually for issues of speed it is more natural to think of better as being higher. Metaphorically it also âfeels rightâ that the faster results appear to reach the x-axis before the slower ones, as if you were looking at the finish line.</p><p>We packed the results into a frame based on a dynamic axis which just had a buffer of 1% above and below the fastest and slowest results.We experimented with different medal sizes and line widths to get a balance between visibility and resolution of the data.</p><p>There was a technical barrier differentiating in marker shape between male and female results but because the times were always so different (and womenâs results consistently slower than menâs) this didnât prove a problem ultimately.</p><p>As well as the data on the line chart, we wanted to include details of the races for users to lookup in a pop-up box and provide a range of summary statistics to form some deeper analysis of the events and across the sports:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.visualizing.org/visualizations/pursuit-faster\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5919\" title=\"Submission Screenshot2\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Submission-Screenshot2-600x410.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"410\"></a></p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Colour and background</strong></span> -Â The colour scheme was designed to be a very limited palette, with little or no decoration.Â The obvious temptation for an Olympics piece is to follow the colour of the five rings but this didnât mean anything of worth for this design. Most of the background is pure white and the fonts and chart apparatus are subtle grey. Initially a concept for the title was created based on a montage of all the Olympic Gamesâ posters but this proved to be unnecessarily distracting.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5942\" title=\"TitleImage\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/TitleImage-600x62.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"62\"></p><p>The colours of the medals were used for the line/medal markers on the main chart and a non-patronising (the lazy use of blue vs. pink) palette of dark blue and orange was chosen for the summary stats to differentiate genders. The grey-shaded panels just helped to frame the individual charts without battling for attention with the data.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Interactivity</strong></span> â The main interactive features involved allowing the user to change their sport, event and data selection, with toggle filters for medals and genders. Additionally, a hover (athlete, result) and click (pop-up of race details) event was programmed for interacting with the main chart. Hereâs an early technical version to get the concept working initially:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5949\" title=\"Version2\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Version2-600x375.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"375\"></p><p>In an ideal world, with extra time, we intended to create a sort button to switch between âby yearâ and âby fastest timeâ view and we would have liked to have incorporated a visual ârulerâ when you hovered over a marker to create a horizontal line allowing you to see the faster and slower results easier.</p><p>The summary statistics and a view of the raw data were included using a neat concertina device to show/hide these extra elements.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Arrangement</strong></span> -Â The main decisions around arranging the design involved whether to go for a portrait (years on the Y, times on the X) or landscape layout (years on the X, times on the Y). We correctly (in my opinion) settled for the latter. We also had to decide where to position the selection tabs and filters, eventually placing them across the top. All this would be packed into a central web page dimension of 960px wide to maximise screen compatibility.</p><p>As mentioned above, gridlines, tickmarks, axes and axis labels, borders and tabs were all reduced as much as possible in terms of their visual prominence.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Annotation</strong></span> â The annotation was important to maximise the user assistance. We included a brief introduction to allow people to get on with using the visualisation but then included a further âaboutâ page with much more detail about the function, intention and background to the project. The font throughout was âMyriad Web Proâ apart from the title which was created using âKozuka Gothic Proâ.</p><p>In terms of the tools used to construct this piece:</p><p>Aside from the time pressures, in terms of judging ourselves when we felt it was completed we established the following criteria to measure our own satisfaction:</p><p>We felt we had achieved all these reasonably well. Then we considered theÂ criteria set out by the contest:</p><p>Instinctively, once again, we feel we will have delivered on the first (important) issue of understanding. Originality in this piece isnât particularly achievable because the visualisation method (ie. essentially a line chart) is the best way of conveying our data story, and so any alternative approach would have potential lost this message. The style is really a personal judgment but I think this conveys a certain elegance through its clarity.</p><p>The contest runs through to the end of the Olympic games and there are prizes for best interactive, the best infographic (not relevant) and the <em>peopleâs choice</em>Â which is something you can influence.</p><p>If you are registered on Visualizing.org and like this piece enough to motivate the simple <a href=\"http://www.visualizing.org/visualizations/pursuit-faster\" target=\"_blank\">clicking on to a heart icon</a> then we will be very grateful!</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Over the past few months its been hard to ignore the quantity of <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/media/2012/04/silicon-valley-brogrammer-culture-sexist-sxsw\" target=\"_blank\">stories</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18922629\" target=\"_blank\">incidents</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jun/29/science-girl-thing-viral-fiasco\" target=\"_blank\">awful mis-judgments</a> that highlight a certain under-representation and sub-standard treatment of women amongst the science and technology sectors.</p><p>One term that seems to pop-up in most of these accounts is â<a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/07/tech/web/brogrammers/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">brogrammer</a>â, a fusion of words to signify a specific cohort of programmers with frat-boy characteristics, and this culture is something that appears to have been developing in recent times, particularly in parts of the tech world.</p><p>Seeing these stories emerging in fields that overlap or have a natural association with data visualisation made me wonder if there were any gender-related issues prevalent in our subject area. I knew we still had issues in society at large (recent evidence <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670184/infographic-in-politics-coverage-no-one-asks-women-about-womens-issues\" target=\"_blank\">1</a> and <a href=\"http://projects.flowingdata.com/salary/\" target=\"_blank\">2</a>) but I was curious if there were any specific community or subject-related issues in data visualisation and infographic design.</p><p>However, going beyond a basic curiosity and turning it into something constructive was difficult. I honestly wasnât sure how to handle it: was it even something I should look into? As a freelance male in the field without any personal experiences or observations of poor treatment towards female Iâm not exactly best placed to offer observations about this issue after all. Furthermore, by simple drawing attention to this issue would it prove to be a positive action or could it run the risk of being clumsy, patronising, tokenistic and just generally ill-judged, creating noise about an issue that didnât need it?</p><p>Never-the-less, the matter of whether data visualisation was âgender blindâ felt like an important and interesting topic and I did want to put the question out there to find out if there are any observations from within the field where women have felt they get a rough deal, feel like they get treated differently to men, experience more limited opportunities etc.</p><p>So I decided that I didnât want to write it myself but simply facilitate a discussion to see if there are any issues that surface, find out what they are and see what can be done about them, if not, we move on. I invited a few participants to offer their thoughts on the topic in the hope of collating a sample of perspectives.Â This invite to participate wasnât an exclusive golden-ticket, by the way, just a few people I either know in the field or whose names happened to pop up on my twitter timeline at a time when I was thinking about it. A couple of people I approached politely declined the offer which is absolutely fine.</p><p>Anyway, the final piece is presented below as a mixture of responses to the questions I posed and more open-styled responses to the general subject. I was going to split them up over a number of posts to reduce the content in a single article but that would mean potentially fragmenting the discussion so Iâve piled everything in to one.</p><p>I hope this creates a positive reaction because its intention is simply to ask a question and trigger a discussion. I therefore hope to see some constructive observations in the comments section from anyone, male or female.</p><p>Finally, I want to sincerely thank all who contributed to this article. If you think about it, its a bit of a tricky call deciding to take part in a discussion like this but every respondent has been superbly honest, open and constructive in their support for this piece and I wish them all the very best!</p><p>And so, in purely random order, and presented verbose, as receivedâ¦</p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.periscopic.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5859\" title=\"KimRees\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/KimRees.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\"></a></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">1) What would you describe your role/position/title or discipline in the field?</span></strong><br>\nIâm CEO and Co-founder of Periscopic, a socially-conscious data visualization firm. I have a computer science background.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">2) How long have you been working in the field?</span></strong><br>\nIâve been working in the interactive field for almost 20 years and specifically in data visualization for 8 years.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">3) What barriers to entry have you seen or felt in this field?</span></strong><br>\nThe data visualization field (in its current incarnation) is nascent and that, combined with the trendiness of it, contribute to a spirit akin to the wild West. It seems to be a free for all of how to do it, what is possible, whoâs able to do it, etc. Iâve seen people from sociology, political, mathematics, design, psychology, and other backgrounds entering the field of data visualization. More structure may emerge as we all figure out this field, but currently there seem to be few barriers.</p><p>However, I do believe the media isnât painting a picture of parity in the data fields. Journalists currently seem infatuated with most of our male counterparts whom are interviewed time and again for their expertise in our trendy discipline. There are a lot of women in the field. I would like to see them lauded in the media as much as the men.</p><p>This lack of inclusion in the media can create the perception that the dataviz field is male-dominated and can lead to fewer women feeling compelled to enter it.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>4) In general how do you perceive the culture/community of data visualisation?</strong></span><br>\nI think itâs incredibly supportive and welcoming. It seems to be driven more by the desire to bolster the practice of visualization rather than by business. As such, there can often be very spirited discussions and critiques of visualizations, but I see these as helping the discipline as a whole become better, more exacting, meaningful, and important.</p><p>Iâm frequently impressed by the collective knowledge, insight, good humor, and openness of the community.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">5) Have you experienced (observed or directly been involved) any negativity surrounding gender issuesâ¦</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(a) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of a design project?</span><br>\nNo</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(b) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of a technology/programming solution?</span><br>\nNo.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(c) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of analysis/stats?</span><br>\nNo.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(d) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of a specific subject matter?</span><br>\nNo.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(e) â¦through involvement/participation/attendance at conferences?</span><br>\nNo, quite the contrary. I feel I get preferential treatment as some conference organizers, such as OâReilly, specifically look for diversity in their speakers.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(f) â¦interactions over social media?</span><br>\nNo.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">6) Have you ever felt compelled and comfortable to act on anything you have witnessed or experienced?</span></strong><br>\nn/a</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>7) Finally, how would you contrast your experiences in this field with any experiences or observations you have made about other related fields such as science, technology, maths/statistics, design or industry?</strong></span></p><p>Of all the computer science related sub-disciplines Iâve been a part of, data visualization is by far the most friendly. Iâve been involved in the fields of gaming, physical computing, web development, and IT. Some of these more than others are more male dominated, competitive, and almost antagonistic, making them hard or at least intimidating to break into for women. I once launched a small website boycotting Duke Nukem because of its sexism and received a lot of hate mail including people telling me to die. It was striking to me that there was such aggression directed at me as a woman over a simple call to action they could have easily ignored. Some men in male-dominated fields, apparently, feel that being in the vast majority allows them to be more domineering or wanton. I once had a boss that told me I had to wear skirts to work. You can see similar cases of this such as the recent Secret Service scandal.</p><p>Perhaps my familial and welcoming perception of the dataviz field is due in part to social media. Nowadays itâs easy to connect with fellow practitioners, academics, and even celebrities in a given field. Pre-Twitter, we had to rely on introductions and cold calling/emailing to make these connections. Additionally, social media in some ways holds people accountable because their identities are attached to them as opposed to the days of BBSs and forums where anonymity reigned, making it far easier to behave in malicious ways without repercussion.</p><p>Whatever the case may be, Iâve encountered nothing but support and encouragement from the dataviz community, although Iâm still waiting for my profile piece in Fast Company or the New York Times. <img src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" class=\"wp-smiley\"></p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.datatelling.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5860\" title=\"JenLowe\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JenLowe.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\"></a></p><p>My first rule of being a woman in tech is donât talk about women in tech, but Iâm very bad at following rules, and Iâm so happy to see Andy tackling this issue, so here I go (again).</p><p>For me, the âwomen in techâ issue is more usefully understood as the intersection of two greater problems: the women in public problem, and the diversity in tech problem.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Diversity in Tech</strong></span></p><p>I think âwomen in techâ is the safe discussion of diversity, and leaves out: race, class, more. So I want to quickly get a little unsafe with you: if you think women are underrepresented in tech, look around for people of color. I do this when I feel lonely at conferences; itâs a good practice in perspective.</p><p>There is invisible diversity that is almost never discussed. For instance, class. How lucky we are if we have the resources to be at a conference in the first place, to buy these shiny objects we make our work on. How many interested talented people have no hope of being able to attend, of having the tools we take for granted.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Women in Public</strong></span></p><p>Last October at VisWeek I was walking around downtown Providence to get dinner, the lone woman out on the street, and the vibe was a little hostile. I tweeted âOne of my favorite things is wandering around alone in strange cities. Sometimes this makes me wish I was a man.â Last week, after running a meetup in Portland, I was walking along a busy street just before 10pm. A man in a black suv rolled to a stop next to me and asked the classic âdo you want a ride?â Usually this sort of thing is a bad joke, but he was a little more threatening than normal. I noticed I was the only woman on the street, and at that point my night was over: retreat to the hotel.</p><p>These are blog post friendly examples; the threats and acts against my safety in public go far beyond this. This is not to make you feel sorry or particularly concerned for me. Iâm a grown woman. I know what Iâm getting into. Thereâs no reason public spaces have to be this way, but they are. Walking around at night by myself is both a pastime and a conscious act of resistance against public spaces without women.</p><p>At the beginning of every tech conference, when the âthere are so few women hereâ alarm is sounded, I want to say: Letâs look around more often and be honest. How many women do you see in male public spaces in general? Women on the street at night? Female business travelers in the airport?</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Professional Experiences: Data Vis &amp; Math</strong></span></p><p>A listing of unfortunate events that have happened to me professionally as a woman in math and data vis.</p><p>Iâve realized, halfway through a semester, that my voice sounded weird in class because I was the only woman who had ever spoken. Iâve been the only woman in a class where the professor started every new proof with âIf a guy wants toâ¦.â This is how I learned that âguysâ isnât as neutral as we pretend it is. Iâve been in classes where no one spoke to me the entire semester (and were then shocked to find out who ruined the curve).</p><p>Iâve been seated at the wives and girlfriends table. Iâve been asked many times who my boyfriend is by people searching to explain my attendance at an event.</p><p>Iâve been ignored. Iâve been introduced as an afterthought or not at all. Iâve watched, on many occasions, women in professional partnerships with men be treated by the press and public as invisible appendages.</p><p>Iâve been called out publicly as the only woman at a table and asked to respond immediately as to why more women werenât in attendance. (Some of you reading this were there.)</p><p>Iâve been mistaken for other women. Molly Steenson and I gave very different Ignite talks at Eyeo, but a non-trivial number of men started conversations with me thinking I was Molly. (A tiny sample, but no woman mixed us up.) Techy gentlemen, let me tell you: if I can tell you apart, if I can recognize an individual in a sea of black rimmed glasses and shaggy hair, I know you can discriminate two blonde women.</p><p>Stop â did you notice the part of my Eyeo story where men were approaching me to talk about my work and ideas? Yeah. That does not happen often. Despite the mixups, an explicit recommendation: Women, come to Eyeo next year, youâll be happy you did. Eyeo is the by far the best event Iâve been to in terms of being listened to and not ignored.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p><p>The story is too long and sad to tell without a drink, but math as a field was ruined for me by experiences that happened because of my gender.</p><p>I decided I would never waste my energy that way again â if, after a few knocks at the door in good faith, a field doesnât want me, a person or group ignores me, I walk away.</p><p>If you flick through who data vis people follow on Twitter, you wonât see many female faces, and youâll see almost no color. I make a daily decision to be in public online, to have my face as an avatar, to engage, to be visible in the stream. I choose to be visible online consciously, and at some risk, in the same way that I choose to be in male public spaces offline.</p><p>I make this effort because I believe that increasing the diversity of visible voices in data vis will make the community stronger.</p><p>I knocked (loudly, a lot) and the data vis community opened its doors to me. So many people publicly, privately, and in invisible ways, have supported me in making massive changes in my life this past year. So many that I canât list them, but can say: you know who you are, and thank you.</p><p>Lately Iâve been thinking about this: âYou can have anything you want, you just have to pay the cost.â If we want to increase diversity in data vis, we can make it happen; we have to decide to pay the cost. The cost is dedicated individual effort, it is you remembering someoneâs name; you remembering to name the female partner in a partnership; you introducing people who should be introduced; you asking people about their work; you recommending people to clients; you talking to people who donât look like your friends.</p><p>Something to make it easier: you donât have to get it right every time. Iâve put my foot in my mouth terribly, though Iâm aiming for less regularly. We all make mistakes, we all have thoughtless moments. One moment doesnât make a person, but somehow all our collective moments do add up to make a community. If everyone who reads this decides to make the effort, the moments will add up. What a community we can have if we decide to pay the cost.</p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.nbr-graphs.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5861\" title=\"NaomiBRobbins\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/NaomiBRobbins.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"193\"></a></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">1) What would you describe your role/position/title or discipline in the field?</span></strong><br>\nSeminar leader, short course instructor, speaker, author on presenting data clearly</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">2) How long have you been working in the field?</span></strong><br>\n15 years</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">3) What barriers to entry have you seen or felt in this field?</span></strong><br>\nNone.

Perhaps itâs aÂ graphic design sort of issueâ¦I wonder if people coming from aÂ graphic design background are possibly more sensitive to criticism andÂ how it is worded as opposed to other fields. I find many of my graphicÂ designer friends and I tend to attach to our work in a more emotionalÂ way than other industries.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">5) Have you experienced (observed or directly been involved) any negativity surrounding gender issuesâ¦</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"> (a) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of a design project?<br>\n(b) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of a technology/programming solution?<br>\n(c) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of analysis/stats?<br>\n(d) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of a specific subject matter?<br>\n(e) â¦through involvement/participation/attendance at conferences?<br>\n(f) â¦interactions over social media?</span></p><p>I havenât answered any of these because I havenât felt this in any specific way. Sometimes the differences feel more intangible, I guess. I produce quite different work than other data practitioners, and I often feel as though there is a barrier between myself and the more technically-minded, though itâs hard to know whether this is just down to the difference in our work or the difference in our gender, particularly as there *are* more men in data visualisation anyhow. One thing I do notice, however, is that after I speak at conferences it sometimes feels that more women approach me after conferences than men. Again, Iâm not sure why this is.</p><p>I have felt the gender imbalance more greatly at conferences, both with speakers and with the attendees, though this might differ by the conference (Eyeo felt more balanced, whereas at See conference in Germany there were more male speakers)â¦at a dinner after the See conference this year there were at least 30 men and only two women! Of course, all the people in these various settings are all good, lovely people. But in a situation where you feel like the odd one out it can make you feel more self-conscious or more shy, less confident to speak your view, depending on your personality. I can feel shy in situations where I donât know anyone and this is amplified in an all-male environment.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">6) Have you ever felt compelled and comfortable to act on anything you have witnessed or experienced?</span></strong><br>\nI donât think I feel comfortable to take to Twitter or social media to discuss this, but that might just be my nature. I am happy talking about these sorts of things with other data practitioners, however.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">7) Finally, how would you contrast your experiences in this field with any experiences or observations you have made about other related fields such as science, technology, maths/statistics, design or industry?</span></strong><br>\nIn the design world I feel like there is still a âboys clubâ mentality in some cases, but itâs tempered by the fact that I know a large group of successful female designers and illustrators. In comparison to the design world (and the digital world) the data world feels more obviously male, and harder to access/engage with, but again: Iâm not sure if this is either down to the nature of data folk or their gender.</p><p>In short: I am a graphic designer and lots of data folk are programmers / scientists. I donât know whether I feel slightly intimidated due to the personality differences between the fields or if its because of gender!</p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://dataveyes.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5864\" title=\"CarolineGoulard\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CarolineGoulard.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\"></a></p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">1) What would you describe your role/position/title or discipline in the field?</span></strong><br>\nI am one of the 4 co-founders of Dataveyes, a start-up specialized in data-visualization</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">2) How long have you been working in the field?</span></strong><br>\nSince 2009 and my degree into media management.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>3) What barriers to entry have you seen or felt in this field?</strong></span><br>\nI have no seen any barriers to entry in this field, in France, probably because of the immaturity of this market in my country. When we began designing data visualization, we were in a way pioneers in France to blog about this subject, to give conference about this subject, to âmarketâ our self as âdatavizâ specialist, etc.</p><p>I come from the media field, which I studied during five years, that also give us some visibility, around the thematic of the data journalism, and made us different from the statisticians, cartographs, or other data-analyst that could have worked far before us on data visualization, without beneficing the same media cover.</p><p>I think our positioning also helped us enter this field: since the beginning at Dataveyes we mix technical skills, with an approached focused on user, information, and storytelling, and that was new in France.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">4) In general how do you perceive the culture/community of data visualisation?</span></strong><br>\nIt is a very open minded community in my opinion. It is a passionate and inquiring community, always exploring, in search of novelty and discoveries about what we can visualize, always creating new way to draw this visual and interactive language to communicate information buried inside data. It is also a rigorous culture, seeking to combine logic and harmony, mathematics and aesthetics, analyse and intuition.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">5) Have you experienced (observed or directly been involved) any negativity surrounding gender issuesâ¦</span></strong></p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(a) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of a design project?</span><br>\nNo</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(b) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of a technology/programming solution?</span><br>\nNo</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(c) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of analysis/stats?</span><br>\nNo</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(d) â¦through the evaluation/feedback/discussion of a specific subject matter?</span><br>\nNo</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(e) â¦through involvement/participation/attendance at conferences?</span><br>\nNo. On the contrary, in France, the new technology field is mainly masculine. When youâre a young woman, and when you are able to tell the story of your work, I have the feeling it is easier to be invited to conferences, because organizers aim diversity, rhythm, dynamism, etc., to make their event interesting. I did not feel any negativity against women. In France, I have the feeling that new technology community would like to welcome more women, but for cultural reason, there are less women likely to choose this field to make their career.</p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">(f) â¦interactions over social media?</span><br>\nNo</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">6) Have you ever felt compelled and comfortable to act on anything you have witnessed or experienced?</span></strong><br>\nN/A</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">7) Finally, how would you contrast your experiences in this field with any experiences or observations you have made about other related fields such as science, technology, maths/statistics, design or industry?</span></strong></p><p>Due to my young age, I did not have many experiences into other professional field, but I feel the data visualization field as an innovative &amp; always moving group, where everything is possible.</p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://dataveyes.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5863\" title=\"SarahSlobin\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/SarahSlobin.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\"></a></p><p>Being a journalist has nearly ruined my ability to be candid. I fact-check myself when I speak, start my sentences over to add context, attribute ideas that arenât mine and feel uncomfortable making definitive statements that I donât know to be fact.</p><p>So Iâve been struggling with how to present my personal take on gender issues at work. If a man behaved badly should I also present an example of a woman behaving badly? Or for balance an example of a man behaving in a lovely manner?</p><p>Itâs taken awhile to arrive at the following framework:</p><p>Context: Iâve spent more than two decades at news organizations where women have had positions of power. My career has been graced by many female mentors who have made my rise possible. (Iâm a visual journalist.)</p><p>Balance: The older I get, the more of a humanist I become. Gender is not a filter for how I view people. Also, I understand that sometimes there is a cognitive gap between perceived and actual offenses.</p><p>Caveat: Iâve had stellar colleagues, both male and female. I have experienced women behaving badly. This is not about that.</p><p>What this is: Some examples of negative experiences that Iâve had with men during my career + some Insight into why I found the behavior offensive. Note: not all bad behavior is equal and all this represents outliers within the subculture of these workplaces</p><p>1) Meeting with an editor about a story, he told me to make sure to incorporate pictures of either âcocktails, meat or women, because thatâs what draws readers to a pageâ<br>\nSo, women, meat and booze are not equal. While I understood his logic, I also understood that this blatant objectification was meant to provoke me because I was a woman. Which was low, and annoying.</p><p>2) One morning the colleague I shared a cubicle with took out several bottles of cologne and asked me if Iâd like to âchoose his scent.â<br>\nThis guy was confusing proximity with intimacy. He also crossed the line into the world of physicality. (Sadly for him, he was later fired for browsing pornography at work.)</p><p>3) There was a sports editor I had to duck for almost a year because he kept asking me out. When Iâd tell him I had a boyfriend, heâd suggest I do what he did and lie.<br>\nRelationships at work are a bad idea, but I get that they happen. This was past the âtake a hintâ stage though. When Iâm at work, if you really want me to find you interesting â try working with me, not presenting yourself as a lying cad.</p><p>4) A friend of mine confided in her manager out of courtesy that she was pregnant, but not ready to share that information. The manager then pressured her to go public so he could line up a replacement for her.<br>\nWhile I donât expect men to understand pregnancy or how scary it can be, I donât think itâs too much to ask someone to understand that private information is private. Also, when you choose your administrative tasks over your obligation to the human race everyone loses.</p><p>5) A colleague who fancied himself good-looking told many of us that we were his âwork-wifeâ so weâd deliver better work for him. âEveryone has a wife at home and a wife at work.â<br>\nA) I never accepted the proposal B) His polygamist tendencies were pathetic C)He wasnât all that</p><p>So have men gotten in my way at work? Sure. So have women. For balance though, and this is just me, you should know: Iâve been referred to as âa force of nature,â âthe intrepidâ and told âget it done, just donât kill anyone.â So getting in my way is possible. Stopping me altogether â¦ X or Y chromosomes make little difference.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

One of the most ambitious, unique, multi-faceted and fundamentally exciting projects will be launched next week, it is called â<a href=\"http://emoto2012.org/\" target=\"_blank\">emoto</a>â and is something you will be hearing a great deal about.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://emoto2012.org/\"><img src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/emoto_logo_transparent.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"emoto_logo_transparent\" width=\"640\" height=\"248\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5839\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://emoto2012.org/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5808\" title=\"emoto-letterbox\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/emoto-letterbox.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\"></a></p><p><a href=\"emoto2012.org\" target=\"_blank\">Emoto</a> is a new artistic data visualisation project created byÂ <a href=\"http://www.hemment.org\" target=\"_blank\">Drew Hemment</a>Â (artist, curator and director of the <a href=\"http://futureeverything.org/\" target=\"_blank\">FutureEverything</a> festival), <a href=\"http://moritz.stefaner.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Moritz Stefaner</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nand.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Studio NAND</a>. In this age of social media and real-time availability of public perception, this project will be the first to capture, measure and artistically portray the ongoing online response and âemotional toneâ surrounding the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.Â This real-time monitoring will allow anyone to see what events, athletes or particular stories are resulting in the most online chatter.</p><p>âThis projectâ¦ will bring to life the most compelling aspect of any Games, the emotional intensity of the audience response, the hot topics raised, the essence and the pulse of London2012. This is not a scientific representation but an artistic representation and it will be a unique contribution to the London 2012 Festival experience creating a shared experience for across the globe. This will change the way people consume major sporting and cultural events because for the first time you receive instant feedback from other people around the world who are sharing that experience.â</p><p>The discoveredÂ sentiments will be displayed in a series of infographics (sample below) which show whether the reactions are positive (orange) or negative (blue).Â This sentiment information is visualised in three ways:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://emoto2012.org/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5822\" title=\"Emoto-Main\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Emoto-Main.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"905\"></a></p><p>These infographics will capture the change in moods in real-time as the events unfold and as the key insights emerge, the team will beÂ blogging about the most interesting findings and patterns emerging from the the digital visualisations.</p><p>Throughout the Games, residents and visitors to London will also be able to download the âemoto in Londonâ app for android; a mobile app, created by researchers at the <a href=\"http://senseable.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">SENSEable City La</a>b, which uses live twitter information to create a real-time augmented reality visualization of the online response to the Games on the handheld device.</p><p>Once the games have completed, the project will continue to evolve in a fascinating way. The raw material of the millions of online interactions will be transformed into a 3D artwork to create a landscape of the collected sentiment data. It will be milled onto 19 plates, each of which represents a record of the emotional response over one day of the event. The artwork will go on show at <a href=\"http://www.nwfor2012.com/whatson/weplayexpo\" target=\"_blank\">WE PLAY Expo</a> from 7 â 9 September 2012 in Preston.</p><p>And thatâs not all! The project will also culminate in â<a href=\"http://festival.london2012.com/events/9000965129\" target=\"_blank\">emoto in London</a>â; a large scale public sound installation which translates the sentiment-analyzed Twitter data into a 48-channel harmonic experience, which will be on show in Trafalgar Square from August 29 â September 9.</p><p>All in all this is an amazingÂ sounding project, one of the most creative and ambitious visualisationÂ developments I can recall. You can read more about â<a href=\"http://emoto2012.org/\" target=\"_blank\">emoto</a>â once it is live on the dedicated site and follow developments on the newly set-up <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emoto\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> feed.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

Such events offer the benefits of receiving a full training session but with the content and activities designed, where possible, to suit the clientâs specific requirements.

    "content": "<p>Yesterday evening, on a train journey home, I was musing about the reading I need to line up over the summer. One of the subjects that jumped to the front of my mind was that of typography. After all these years studying data visualisation, an sufficient understanding of which typefaces are most effective and elegant for different purposes had so far eluded my attention and represented a gap in my knowledge. Iâve had no formal design training so every choice I make around typefaces is based largely on instinct.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5754\" title=\"Typeface\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Typeface.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"367\"></p><p>And so I took to Twitter to undertake a crude, mini-survey to obtain feedback from followers on the fonts they perceive to be the best for a) displaying numbers and b) text items on a visualisation. </p><p>Strangely enough, the vast majority of responses I received said they didnât know and were more interested in what others were saying, which is why I decided to publish this post and start a discussion.

    "content": "<p>With the start of the 2012 London Olympics fast approaching, the quantity of infographics and visualisations about the games are naturally popping up everywhere. Of course the subject of these will tend to be about the sporting events themselves but one that has come to my attention today offers a beautifully simple approach to portray some alternative information.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://oceaniaeuropeamericasafricaasia.tumblr.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5727\" title=\"OlympicRings\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OlympicRings.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\"></a></p><p>Entitled â<a href=\"http://oceaniaeuropeamericasafricaasia.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">oceaniaeuropeamericasafricaasia</a>â this design produced by Gustavo Sousa uses the Olympic Rings, depicting the continents Oceania, Europe, Americas, Africa and Asia, to portray a range of fascinating global indicators with the size of the ring representing the size of that continentâs value. There are indicators such as homicides, prisoners, catholic and gun ownership.</p><p>There is something so engaging about this minimalist design and bravery too, in choosing not to show the legend, include no labels, no values, and no scale. All that remains is the title, presumably to act as the reminder for the intention of which rings represent which continents (given there is no official intended representation or association). It is reduced to its core purpose of creating a reaction to the different sized rings we see across the gallery.</p><p>However, having looked closely at the data portrayed in the ring sizes, my issue is do the rings themselves actually correspond to the sequence of continents in the title? If you look at <a href=\"http://oceaniaeuropeamericasafricaasia.tumblr.com/post/26663979617\" target=\"_blank\">Population</a>, based on the title I presume the green circle is Africa but Asiaâs population is about 4-times larger than Africa. Is <a href=\"http://oceaniaeuropeamericasafricaasia.tumblr.com/post/26665190084\" target=\"_blank\">Child Mortality</a> really that bad in Europe? Instinctively (maybe Iâm just way off) this feels like it could be the figure for Africa? Does Asia really have the largest <a href=\"http://oceaniaeuropeamericasafricaasia.tumblr.com/post/26665214926\" target=\"_blank\">Coca-Cola</a> sales?</p><p>I suspect the colours are actually, from left to right â <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\">Oceania</span>, <span style=\"color: #ffff00;\">Africa</span>, Europe, <span style=\"color: #00ff00;\">Asia</span>, <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Americas</span> -Â and therefore the project title should be âoceaniaafricaeuropeasiaamericasâ instead!</p><p>I love the minimalist concept and the execution but sufficient doubt has been put in my mind. It could be that this is simply me having pre-conceived ideas about such global indicators but unfortunately I now want to see the labels, the values and the data sources. </p><p>You can see all the images on Gustavoâs dedicated <a href=\"http://oceaniaeuropeamericasafricaasia.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a> or by viewing the video below.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/45658298\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\"></iframe></p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

This trajectory has continued so far during 2012 and has been most notable for his development of <a href=\"http://kartograph.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Kartograph</a>, a ânew framework for building interactive map applications without Google Maps or any other mapping serviceâ. As Gregor outlined, the motivation for creating this was to serve the needs of designers and data journalists. Even though it is still in an early-release state do check out the <a href=\"http://kartograph.org/showcase/\" target=\"_blank\">showcase</a> for a demonstration of what it can and could offer. The development of Kartograph and further <a href=\"http://maps.stamen.com/#watercolor/12/37.7706/-122.3782\" target=\"_blank\">interesting new work</a> from the folks at Stamen signals a new era of creative mapping opportunities.</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">7.

I could have picked out many facets of their work over the past few months for this item but I decided to choose something a little less obvious perhaps. Launched towards the end of 2011, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KevinQ\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Quealy</a>, a Graphics Editor at the NYT, uses his â<a href=\"http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com/\">Chartsnthings</a>â Tumblr to share some of the many fascinating design process narratives that come from behind the scenes in the Graphics Department. I recently <a href=\"http://blog.visual.ly/10-things-you-can-learn-from-the-new-york-times-data-visualizations/\" target=\"_blank\">attempted to identify</a> some of the secretâs behind the NYTâs success but one of the things I neglected was the openness with which they share their process, ideas and working practices. Kevinâs enlightening series of posts, based on graphics he and his colleagues have worked on, provides some fantastic fly-on-the-wall insight into these working processes, the <a href=\"http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com/post/23348191031/amanda-cox-and-countrymen-chart-the-facebook-i-p-o\" target=\"_blank\">decisions they make</a> and the <a href=\"http://chartsnthings.tumblr.com/post/24994361059/making-mistakes-outside-the-chart\" target=\"_blank\">options they reject</a> along the way. It is now an absolute must-read site and one of my very favourites. You can also catch Kevin on this great <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFpIE8xY_w8\" target=\"_blank\">video of a talk</a> he gave at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis in March 2011.</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/04/the-data-journalism-handbook-is-now-live/\" target=\"_blank\">8.

Featuring a collaboration of contributions from over 70 of the leading global voices of authority, it was released only 6 months after its conception. Iâve not read it cover to cover but the chapters I have been through were excellent pieces and I would urge anyone who has an interest in this burgeoning field to take a read of the <a href=\"http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/\" target=\"_blank\">free web version</a> or look out for the <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025603.do\" target=\"_blank\">OâReilly e-book and printed book</a>.</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"http://www.domusweb.it/en/design/in-screen-sports-graphics/\" target=\"_blank\">9.

As a keen follower of sports, especially football, I often find myself frustrated by the inconsistency of quality and absence of innovation in much of the graphics I see, not just in <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2011/09/distorted-and-misleading-graphics-on-sky-sports/\" target=\"_blank\">broadcasts</a> but also in the print and interactive visualisations that cover and analyse these sports. Whilst we do see the occasional examples of fantastic <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/06/11/sports/basketball/nba-shot-analysis.html\" target=\"_blank\">visualisation</a>, this feels like more an exception than the rule. Indeed, at Malofiej, there was a fair consensus amongst the judging panel that the sports category was probably the weakest of all. And it is a surprise and a shame because the data that is being captured and made available about sports is being enhanced at incredible rates. Thankfully, right at the end of the month, I have been given reason to feel hopeful having read this <a href=\"ttp://www.maxgadney.com/2012/07/domus-article-sports-visualisation.html\" target=\"_blank\">magnificent article</a> by Max Gadney which presents some of the innovations around in-screen graphics. Hopefully over the next 6 months we can see some further improvements across the entire spectrum of visual formats and channels around sport.</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/visual-journalism-editor.html\" target=\"_blank\">10. BBC Visual Journalism unit</a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/visual-journalism-editor.html\"><img src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/10Significant-BBC.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"10Significant-BBC\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5715\"></a></p><p>Finally, I leave with a very late entry to this list, something which has once again come to my attention at the end of the month, but hopefully a development we will look back on as a significant in due course. For many years I have felt the BBC has somewhat punched beneath its weight. It has so much resource, so much creativity, so many amazing talents, an incredibly well-respected journalistic tradition and yet has never really, sufficiently translated this into the innovation, variety and impact of its visualisation or infographic output. To be fair it has created a couple of the most shared and utilised interactive projects of late â the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15391515\" target=\"_blank\">7 billion people</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17543356\" target=\"_blank\">global pay scale</a> pieces â but in (unfair) contrast to the likes of the New York Times, it has never fulfilled its potential. Hopefully, that is about to change with the news of the creation of the Visual Journalism Unit, a single entity to pool talent and coordinate all visual journalism efforts. This will be led by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2012/visual-journalism-editor.html\" target=\"_blank\">Amanda Farnsworth</a> who, as Editor of Visual Journalism, will take the responsibility after the Paralympics for moving the beeb forward on the visualisation front and hopefully help to realise its incredible potential.

Furthermore, I feel I have learned so much from my experiences interacting and hearing insights from delegates on my training courses.

Based on the mentions, valves are triggered to release the appropriate flavoured from vessels based on the proportion of mentions. With the ever changing references to fruit on Twitter, each smoothie created has a unique blend of flavours. Thatâs not allâ¦</p><p>Data from which the smoothie is created are graphically represented on a computer screen. It shows the proportions of flavors in the current smoothie as well as the most recent tweets from which the smoothie was created.

    "content": "<p><a href=\"http://www.corriere.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Corriere della Sera</a> is an Italian daily newspaper (broadsheet) and <a href=\"http://lettura.corriere.it/\" target=\"_blank\">La Lettura</a> is a cultural supplement published in the Sunday edition of the newspaper. The supplement is highly regarded and includes articles and works from the most famous Italian experts on art, cinema, literature and society, amongst other subjects. Every week they dedicate a page of this supplement to visual exploration via the âVisual Dataâ section and these works are produced by design agency <a href=\"http://www.accurat.it/thinks/\" target=\"_blank\">Accurat</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.visualizing.org/embedded/41537\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p><p>For their La Lettura pieces, Accurat designs â<em>visual stories that depict the complexity of cultural, economical and social phenomena and systems</em>â and they do this within the typical constraints of a newspaper editorial pressure cooker! Each piece begins on a Monday and the final solution is produced by Thursday AM. There is no real chance for preparation work to be carried out beforehand because it is not until Monday that the proposed and agreed topics are finalised.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/giorgialupi\" target=\"_blank\">Giorgia Lupi</a>, one of the founders of Accurat, described to me the process behind their weekly challenge:</p><p>We start from a topic that we would like to explore and spend the first half-day understanding which could be the most interesting, unexpected, relevant or unexplored phenomena to highlight. By this point weâve had the first ideas and intuitions about the visualisation on paper. We then try to confirm it [the concept] by working with the data we choose. Sometimes, of course, we have to come back to the first step! We define a final criteria to use and we look for other kind of data that would be interesting to compare, relate or (even very different ones) to contrast. We then play with and develop the visualisationâ¦</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.visualizing.org/embedded/41583\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\"></iframe></p><p>The key point here is that they set out to find unexplored stories, never starting from the visual tools or programming languages, rather inventing a new visual model every week, first on paper and then simply with illustrator. Through the analysis of the context and the available information Accurat designs and realizes the most effective visual metaphors and diagrams to unveil the stories that lie â<em>hiding between the folds of numbers and data</em>â.</p><p>One really interesting facet of this work, picking up on my recent post about <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/08/discussion-defining-your-data-visualisation-style/\" target=\"_blank\">defining visual style</a>, is this comment from Giorgiaâ¦</p><p>On La Lettura we have to work with the Corriere della Seraâs graphic rules (colors of background, dimensions of the artworks, only 2 fonts available etc.) and this creates, of course, a first-glance visual consistency throughout all the visualizations!</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.visualizing.org/embedded/41535\" width=\"620\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\"></iframe></p><p>All the work done by Accurat on this Visual Data section is published on <a href=\"http://www.visualizing.org/galleries/la-lettura-visual-data\" target=\"_blank\">visualizing.org</a> and includes a short, English description. Translated pieces may be published in due course. You can read more about the work of Accurat <a href=\"http://www.accurat.it/does/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><p>Many thanks to Giorgia for taking the time to explain about her and her teamsâ excellent work!</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>About a month ago I <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/07/announcing-my-next-data-visualisation-training-locations/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the locations of my forthcoming series of âIntroduction to Data Visualisationâ <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training/\" target=\"_blank\">one-day training courses</a>. After resolving some diary issues, I am finally now in position to announce the schedule of dates:</p><p>Â </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Costs</strong></span><br>\nThe basic delegate rates are Â£225 per person for UK/EU events and Â£250 per person for events held elsewhere outside the EU. There are additional VAT costs as follows:</p><p>No separate, additional registration fees are charged to delegates â these are all absorbed within the rate.<br>\nÂ </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Course details</strong></span><br>\nThere is plenty of information about the objectives, coverage and content of the training courses <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. You can also see a selection of the <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training-testimonials/\" target=\"_blank\">testimonials</a> I have received from attendees at previous events. The most important point to stress is that there are no pre-requisites in terms of knowledge, skills, or technical capabilities â you just need to have a curiosity and desire to enhance the effectiveness of your data visualisation designs, regardless of whether you are the designers, the commissioners or the evaluators of such work.<br>\nÂ </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Registration</strong></span><br>\nYou will be able to formally register for the event next week. However, if you wish to reserve a place before then just <a href=\"mailto:andy@visualisingdata.com\" target=\"_blank\">email me</a> and I will hold a spot for you. You can then formally register when the registration mechanism is available. Credit card and PayPal payments will be accepted but if you would prefer to arrange a BACS transfer via invoice, that is also fine. Just let me know what works for you.<br>\nÂ </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Venues</strong></span><br>\nSpecific venues will be announced as and when I secure appropriate space but typically all events will be as city-central as possible. Details will be updated on the relevant training event pages.<br>\nÂ </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Class size</strong></span><br>\nThe maximum class size is typically between 16 and 20 (varies according to venue rules). This relatively small size helps to facilitate a supportive learning environment with plenty of one-on-one instruction as well as energetic dialogue and group discussion between all attendees.<br>\nÂ </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Times</strong></span><br>\nThe courses will commence at 9:30 and finish around 17:00 with registration commencing from 9:00. There will be short breaks in the morning and afternoon sessions and a lunch break of around 50 minutes.<br>\nÂ </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Refreshments</strong></span><br>\nDrinks/refreshments will typically be arranged on arrival at least. Lunch is not provided but all venues will be picked based on convenient access to appropriate food and drink facilities.<br>\nÂ </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Laptops</strong></span><br>\nYou are encouraged, but not required, to bring a wireless-enabled laptop with you and to be prepared to share your workspace with others. There are no specific programmes or applications required though it will useful if you have Microsoft Excel/OpenOffice Calc and a pdf reader installed.<br>\nÂ </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Delegate Cancellations</strong></span><br>\nIn the event of a delegate needing to cancel their booking, if written notification is received at least 3 days before the date of the course, a full refund will be offered less any processing fees. Should you wish to transfer your course booking to another delegate, that is fine, but please inform Andy Kirk if this situation arises. The best advice is to make sure you can definitely attend the training before booking.<br>\nÂ </p><p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Event Cancellations</strong></span><br>\nIn the extremely rare event that a training course has to be canceled due to unforeseen circumstances you will be offered to attend an alternative event as appropriate or a full refund for your registration. However, liability will be limited to a refund of fees paid and Visualising Data Ltd is not responsible for other costs incurred, such as non-refundable travel or accommodation costs.<br>\nÂ <br><a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training/\">[Back to Training page]</a></p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Last week I was pondering the issue of data visualisation <em>style</em>, a quite ambiguous and hard-to-put-your-finger-on idea that can be interpreted differently depending on your perspective. To me, today, its a combination of tone-of-voice, communication technique and visual identity but tomorrow, if you asked me I might change that definition. So its a hard thing to nail down but I like to discuss things like that.</p><p>If we take an example, most of you out there would probably be able to instantly recognise a <a href=\"http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/\" target=\"_blank\">David McCandless</a> piece or a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/06/sports/olympics/olympic-graphics-collection.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a> graphic because there is an inherent visual quality or technique that leaves a certain stylistic footprint. If someone was influenced by these design styles, others would probably note âhey, thatâs like a David McCandless workâ, just by way of example. </p><p>In other fields of art and design we have endless examples of prominent visual styles, instantly recognisable brands. There are too many for me to list and youâll already know them yourself simply as a consumer, but just two examples would be <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=apple&amp;ion=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=702&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=if8xUJC0OYOR0QWFlIDoDA#um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=apple+products&amp;revid=1114594557&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kf8xUJOzBeay0QWOqYDgDA&amp;ved=0CGkQgxY&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=76af0738af25c87f&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=702\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a> and somebody like <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;tok=zE6jgNXSGRS6pxzhtM4n2g&amp;cp=5&amp;gs_id=5&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=van+gogh&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=702&amp;ion=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=wf8xUN6wF6mN0AXumYHYDA\" target=\"_blank\">Van Gogh</a>. Instantly recognisable visual styles.</p><p>I was thinking about this issue specifically in relation to questioning what (if any) I would consider to be my own style right now and what would I want it to be if I sought to develop and define one. Iâd probably characterise my design work as being more on the analytical/precision side of the spectrum, but is that where I want to keep it? Should I be completely flexible with my style and try to expand my techniques to offer a range of different approaches based on a broad portfolio? Or, do I want to define my own style, identify what I believe to be a core strength, focus on that particular skill and (as I said in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/visualisingdata/status/236111765988069377\" target=\"_blank\">conversation with Scott Murray</a>) determine that I will be THAT guy and be the best at THAT thing and people will recognise me for THAT style.</p><p>Of course, one of the main factors in deciding this will be your personal situation in terms of whether you can afford to narrow your style, and by implication pick and choose work â it is very fortunate if you can and Iâm not claiming to be in that position yet!</p><p>To take this forward I decided to pose the question on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/visualisingdata/status/236108330756624385\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>:</p><p>When it comes to design style, is it more valuable to be considered a flexible/all-rounder or try define your own style and develop a brand?</p><p>â Andy Kirk (@visualisingdata) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/visualisingdata/status/236108330756624385\" data-datetime=\"2012-08-16T14:33:07+00:00\">August 16, 2012</a></p><p>Â </p><p>Just to clarify, the term ârecognitionâ was meant in terms of being recognisable as one of your pieces rather than recognition in the sense of awards/rewards.</p><p>I knew there wouldnât be a universally agreed stance. Its not a single issue decision, I quickly got a wide range of fascinating responses reflecting the difference in interpretation of what âstyleâ means to different people as well as the contrasting perspectives on what is deemed best.

Well, if you want to register you can do so here or, if you want to hang on, I have a complimentary pass valid for both days of the event, including the evening drinks reception on the 19th September. As I said above these are worth a great deal so if you do want to attend it will be a nice bonus for you!</p><p>To keep things simple Iâm going to run a simple prize draw so, if youâre interested in the free pass, <strong>email me andy@visualisingdata.com with your name and details</strong> and Iâll then pull out a randomly selected name at 16:00 (BST) on Thursday 16th August and announce the winner.</p><p><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">** Update: I now have two passes to give away!

    "content": "<p>This is a guest post from Jon Schwabish, an economist and data visualization creator. You can reach him at <a href=\"mailto:jschwabi@yahoo.com\">jschwabi@yahoo.com</a> or by following him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jschwabish\" target=\"_blank\">@jschwabish</a>.</p><p>Â </p><p>As an economist working for the federal government in the United States who also doubles as someone trying to use new data visualization techniques, Iâm often struck by commentary that divides the data visualization community into two broad groups: academics and practitioners. Presumably, such commentators mean to group me and my fellow government analysts into that practitioner category. I think of people in my profession as more than just practitioners of data visualization, however; we use data visualizations to help us create, analyze, interpret, and even publish data and analytic results for a variety of audiencesâthe White House, Congress, regulators, press, the public, or any number of interested groups. Yet the graphical displays many government agencies publish are not employing best practices or new innovations in graphic presentations, such as stand-alone infographics or interactive investigative data tools.</p><p>In my experience, the poor graphical presentation of government data and analysis stems from two factors: First, tight budgets that constrain the ability of government agencies to hire people with skills and backgrounds in graphic design and data visualization; and second, a large number of economists and other analysts who tend to not prioritize graphical displays as part of their analytic presentation. Take, for example, the two graphs below, both of which fail to employ best practices routinely discussed in the data visualization community, namely clear labels and clear presentation of the data. In the firstâa scatterplot that shows the relationship between education and exportsâtry finding the 5 countries the author specifically discusses in the text (China, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand). In the secondâa bar chart of a regionâs trade as a share of GDPâsee if you can figure out which part of the bar belongs to which region.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://irps.ucsd.edu/assets/001/503233.pdf.\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5955\" title=\"JonS1\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JonS1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"477\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Source: Gordon H.

For example, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has been releasing static infographics for about a year now. CBO recently released an infographic about the <a href=\"http://cbo.gov/publication/43432\">Social Security Disability Insurance program</a>, which accompanied an in-depth <a href=\"http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43421\">report</a> on the same topic. (Disclaimer: I am an economist at CBO and also serve as a data visualization specialist at the agency; the thoughts in this post are mine and not those of CBO). The Census Bureau has started its own data visualization efforts and has recently released <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/how/infographics/\">two static infographics</a> on Census data products. The White House employed the services of Edward Tufte as part of the Recovery Independent Advisory Panel to help create new visualizations to better inform the public about how the 2009 <a href=\"http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/default.aspx\">economic stimulus package was spent</a>.</p><p>For every government agency that is creating better graphics, however, there are others creating poor visualizations. And Iâm not just referring to poorly designed infographics or interactive websites; Iâm referring to basic graphics in regular reports, studies, and testimonies. The Government Accountability Office, for example, released the following graph in the introduction of a report in June (my guess is that this graph would make Stephen Few ill).</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/600/592074.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5957\" title=\"JonS3\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JonS3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"232\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"color: #808080;\">Source: Government Accountability Office, Employment for People with Disabilities, <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/assets/600/592074.pdf\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">http://www.gao.gov/assets/600/592074.pdf</span></a>.</span></em></p><p>Or these pie charts from the Social Security Administration (I guess the small gap between the âOtherâ and âSocial Securityâ sections in 1962 must be the missing 2%?):</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/chartbooks/fast_facts/2011/fast_facts11.html#chart6\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5958\" title=\"JonS4\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JonS4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"312\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><em>Source: Social Security Administration, Fast Facts &amp; Figures About Social Security, 2011, <a href=\"http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/chartbooks/fast_facts/2011/fast_facts11.html#chart6\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/chartbooks/fast_facts/2011/fast_facts11.html#chart6</span></a>.</em></span></p><p>Or this 3D column chart on state administrative costs for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps). (Thanks to the 3D representation, the top of the first bar doesnât exceed $1,800 even though itâs labeled $1,833; thereâs also a bizarre y-axis labelââMILLIONS/BILLIONSâ; and the bright yellow color unnecessarily draws the eye to the âADP Categoryââbut I digress).</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/qc/pdfs/2010_state_activity.pdf\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5959\" title=\"JonS5\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/JonS5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"474\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\"><em>Source: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Supplemental Assistance Program (SNAP) State Activity Report, Federal Fiscal Year 2010, <a href=\"http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/qc/pdfs/2010_state_activity.pdf\"><span style=\"color: #808080;\">http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/qc/pdfs/2010_state_activity.pdf</span></a>.</em></span></p><p>Â </p><p>Finally, every month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) releases a report on the employment situation that starts with a line chart and a bar chart and is followed by nearly 40 pages of tables (for example, see <a href=\"http://bls.gov/ces/\">http://bls.gov/ces/</a>). Although the tabular data are available through different extraction tools on the BLS website, perhaps more could be done to present those results visually in order to better show the nationâs employment picture to the general public.</p><p>One impediment to better graphics may be that government agencies areârightfully soâmore focused on creating and analyzing data than on coming up with clear and innovative ways to show it to their constituents. But making better graphics does not require an extensive background in computer programming (though many government analysts are programmers) or graphic design; instead, it requires thinking more carefully and creatively about how to present data and analysis and a willingness to seek guidance from the data visualization community. At the very basic level, that simply means following Tufte: âreduce chartjunkâ and âshow the dataâ.</p><p>Adhering to those guidelines and presenting their data and analysis to the public in clear, easy-to-understand graphics will enable federal agencies to better educate the public about the challenges facing the nation and engage themâand policymakersâin a meaningful dialogue to address those issues.</p><p>Â </p><p><em>Postscript. </em>For an introduction to best practices for data visualization, I recommend any of the books by Edward Tufte but especially <em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em>. Stephen Fewâs books are also excellent, especially <em>Show Me the Numbers</em>.<em> </em>Dona Wongâs <em>The Wall Street Journal Guide to Information Graphics </em>and Naomi Robbinsâ <em>Creating More Effective Graphs</em> both have good lessons, tips, and strategies. If youâre interested in seeing examples of bad graphics and ways in which they can be improved, I recommend <a href=\"http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/\">Junkcharts.com</a>. For those who want to learn how to make better graphics using Excel (many peopleâs graphics workhorse), check out the tutorials at the <a href=\"http://www.peltiertech.com\">Peltiertech.com</a> or <a href=\"http://chandoo.org/wp/\">Chandoo.org</a> websites. Finally, the <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/\">Flowingdata</a> website and associated book <em>Visualize This </em>have excellent examples and tutorials using the R language<em>.</em></p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

Not everything has to be instant, not everything has to be âgotâ in 5 seconds. Like the written word, somethings (like instructions) need to be clear, concise and rapidly digested and others, like novels, can be much more considered and slowly-immersed works.</p><p>However, the critical point of this experiential process is when you pass the initial âformâ judgment â how attracted have you been to the work, has it grabbed your attention, does it offer a subject matter on which you have an interest to learn/read about. This is where we move into the functional stage and where we need to start to feel like we are going to get something out of it. Both these pieces require a great amount of patience and willingness to invest time in learning how to decode and then interpret the graphics. </p><p>I think the <a href=\"http://www.timeplots.com/collections/catalog/products/a-visual-history-of-the-us-house\" target=\"_blank\">Timeplots</a> piece is much more accessible and therefore effective than the xkcd version with which I struggled quite a bit to get my head round, especially the break-off branches. Its kind of a mixture of a stacked area chart and Sankey diagram so involves a great deal of work to understand, even with the excellent attempt at annotated explanation.</p><p>This shows the fine balance all designers are faced with when depicting relatively complex data stories. Can you attract the reader through its form, can you keep them there through function and then deliver to them a learning experience.</p>",

The slider is the star so a hat tip to James and Oliver for deploying this device.</p>",

    "content": "<p><em>This is a final guest post from Jon Schwabish, an economist and data visualization creator, who has been keeping everybody up to date with the daily goings on at VisWeek. I would like to thank Jon so much for his thorough, enlightening and (from my perspective at least) particularly punctual updates! I really appreciate how hard it is to find the time, energy and will to do this on a daily basis at such a all-consuming event like this. You can reach him atÂ <a>jschwabi@yahoo.com</a>Â or by following him on TwitterÂ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jschwabish\" target=\"_blank\">@jschwabish</a>.</em></p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p><p>I lost count of how many presentations I saw over the last few days, but I was struck by the poor slide and presentation design of so many speakers. Even if youâre a computer scientist studying different algorithm design or a researcher working on different visualization perception issues, Visweek is, at its heart, a conference on visualizing data and, as such, I was really disappointed at the overall quality of the slides. Specifically, Iâd like to see fewer bullet points, larger text, more and better images, more narratives, and fewer cute slide transitions. (Some people told me theyâd like to cut down on the number of equationsâIâm not turned off by equations, but I do want to hear some discussion and intuition for the math, instead of presenters thinking that the Greek letters are going to do the job for them.)</p><p>Â </p><p>I survived my first Visweek! I had a tremendous time and was fortunate to meet so many excellent researchers, graduate students, practitioners, computer scientists, programmers, and graphic designers. Thanks to Andy for letting me invade his site for a few days and special thanks to a whole bunch of folks for inviting me into their world and helping me navigate the waters, if only for a few days: Enrico Bertini, Jerome Cukier, Ellie Fields, Danyel Fisher, Jeff Heer, Noah Iliinsky, Robert Kosara, Jen Lowe, Kevin Lynagh, Scott Murray, Hannah Pileggi, Kim Reese, Jonathan Roberts, and Drew Skau. If youâre not familiar with the work of these folksâand apologies to those I omittedâI recommend you go find them (and go bother them for help and advice!).<br>\nSo Iâm now back east where football is on at a decent hour and there are fewer coffee shops per capita. Iâm filled with renewed inspiration to make better and innovative visualizations, and to figure out better ways to communicate information because I believe that communicating data through quality data visualizations can lead to better understanding of complex issues, which will hopefully help us tackle some of the important questions we are all trying to answer.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

Many thanks to Job for his efforts to keep us poor folk who arenât able to make it to this great flagship event.</em></p><p>Â </p><p>I was happy to start the morning with the Visweek Papers Fast Forward, which is where the authors for all 40 or so papers get 30 seconds each to advertise their work. Itâs such a better way to see whatâs coming than reading abstracts. </p><p>My first session was the Visweek Industry Presentations: A View for the Future, which included presentations by representatives from Tableau, Kitware, Intel, IBM, and Microsoft Excel. I got the most out of the talk by Scott Ruble from Excel because he did the best job of looking forwardâhe discussed the various visualization devices, interaction modes (e.g., touchscreens, voice controls), devices, platforms, and services that he thinks are on the horizon for both developers and users. He also previewed the new Excel 2013, which includes a âRecommended Chartsâ option as well as some other new visualization tools. You should be able to get a free preview <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/excel-2013-preview\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Jock Mackinlay did a nice demonstration of Tableau desktop and also gave us a preview of the upcoming mobile version.</p><p>The second session this morningâVisual Analytics in Practiceâfeatured myself, Kevin Lynagh (Kerning Labs) and Shahtab Wahid (Bloomberg). Obviously, this was the best session of the entire week! Kevinâs talk was excellentâsolid slides; good, clear message; nice story; and good advice to students and practitioners. Shahtabâs talk was an interesting look at the visual tools and products heâs helped developed at Bloomberg. (With respect to my talkâmy slides are available here<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jschwabish/visweek-graphics-and-infographics\" target=\"_blank\"></a>. Iâll just say that I got a lot of great feedback from visualization practitioners and academics alike, and Iâm looking forward to heading back to DC with new tools to try, strategies to consider, and people to bother for help).<br>\nÂ </p><p>I wasnât able to see everything this morning, but it was clear from the #Visweek Twitterfeed that there are three papers I need to check out:<br>\n1. Nicholas Kong and Maneesh Agrawala presented a <a href=\"http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/grover/\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> on graphical overlays that are layered onto charts to âfacilitate a larger set of chart reading tasksâ.<br>\n2. The Typographic Map tool by Shehzad Afzal and others, with which you can make maps that merge text and spatial data. You can play with it <a href=\"http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~safzal/typomaps.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.<br>\n3. Justin Talbot, John Gerth and Pat Hanrahanâs <a href=\"http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/slope-ratio-comparison\" target=\"_blank\">paper</a> that shows William Clevelandâs Banking to 45Â° aspect ratio design guideline might not actually be minimized around 45Â° or, as it became to be called here, Clevelandgate.</p><p>Â </p><p>So after my talk and a tasty lunch in Capitol Hill, I was kind of in and out of sessions this afternoon. The tutorial on color theory by Theresa-Marie Rhyne was too technical for me. The panel on Reproducible Visualization Research was more interesting and appears to highlight challenges in the academic community that many fields face. Specifically, the panel was charged with discussing what changes might be needed to visualization research to assure greater reproducibility. Although there are parts of the data visualization field that have been around for a while, much of it is fairly young, so this may just be part of the fieldâs growing pains. I mean, the American Economic Association only introduced a disclosure <a href=\"http://aeaweb.org/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">policy</a> in July 2012. </p><p>I did spend a lot of time in the afternoon talking to a lot of great peopleâpractitioners, academics, programmers, and other people interested in ways in which basic data visualization strategies can be taught to researchers and analysts who may not be as familiar with the available data visualization tools and strategies.</p><p>Â </p><p>I spent about an hour standing by my poster during the Poster Viewing and talked to a lot of people, some of whom were interested in what tools I use to create infographics, how I go about deciding which charts to use for the data at hand, strategies on how to make a good infographic, and how the infographics are used. </p><p>Â <br>\nSo thatâs all for today.

Many thanks to Job for his efforts to keep us poor folk who arenât able to make it to this great flagship event.</em></p><p>So welcome to (my) day 2 of Visweek! Today was even more exciting than yesterday (<a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/10/visweek-updates-by-jon-schwabish-day-1/\" target=\"_blank\">day 1 review here</a>)! As the BioVis folk filtered out and the InfoVis people filtered in, there was a palpable change in energy in the conference area. It could have been more people, or the soda served at the first break, or the break from the rain, but there is definitely a higher energy here today.</p><p>Â </p><p>Today marked my first Visweek Keynote address, given this morning by Mary Czerwinski of Microsoft Research. All three ballrooms were open, the room was packed, and people seemed excited. The talk was interesting, but I was not inspired. She spoke about a number interesting projects Microsoft is working on (and has worked on) and showed some entertaining videos of projects that they worked on back in the day of IE4, as well as some various survey design techniques. Gauging by the number of questions at the end, many people seemed to find it interesting, but I was looking for something bit broader, a sentiment that was shared by a few other conference attendees I spoke with.</p><p>I then turned to my first InfoVis session (in case youâre confused about the differences between all of these âVisâ sessions, Iâll spend some time discussing them in my final post). This session included the âbest paperâ of the conference by <a href=\"http://whitneylab.berkeley.edu/PDFs/Haroz_Whitney_2012_InfoVis.pdf\">Steve Haroz and David Whitney</a> about how to use color to encode information. Steve did a great job presentingâthe authors made three general conclusions, which I adapt below to be a bit more practical:</p><p>I also enjoyed the paper by <a href=\"http://www.cs.brown.edu/~steveg/pubs/Gomez-2012-DSD.pdf\">Steven Gomez and his co-authors </a>, in which the authors asked students in various fields to present research from other academic disciplines. They then visualized the âaverageâ presentation slide and, based on my own experience, I wasnât totally surprised that they found that students from the social sciences (e.g., economics) were more likely to have slides filled with text and bullet points than students in the humanities. The paper by <a href=\"http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/imager/tr/2012/dsm/\">Michael Sedlmair and his co-authors </a> was also a nice paper about design study and I talked to a few people afterwards who thought the lessons from their work were well presented and discussed and could be used as an outline for others undertaking design studies.</p><p>Overall, I donât want to spend too much time dissecting these papers or others in the sessionâIâm not really qualified to do so without reading the papers in detailâbut, in general, I thought the quality of the presentations and the quality of the slides was really quite excellent. The slides were clear of clutter, text was large and sparse, the color choices were simple, and the stories were clear.</p><p>Â </p><p>I had a great lunch with some graduate students, Jerome Cukier, and Drew Skau (from Tableau), and followed that up with some additionally interesting sessions. I will say that the afternoon InfoVis sessions (I did not try the SciVis or VAST sessions today) were a bit more technical than the morning session, so I got a bit less out of them. The paper by Anastasia Bezarios and Petra Isenberg, which tested how well people perceive visual variables from different perspectives in front of a large wall display was really interesting, and I enjoyed the description of the actual experiment.</p><p>I also spent a bit of time in <a href=\"http://www.marekkultys.com/\">Marek Kultysâ</a> tutorial on <em>Good Practice of Visual Communication Design in Scientific and Data Visualization. </em>Marek had a really nice basic-level data visualization course in his 4 hours or so of lecture, including a practical design period in which students were given a design challenge and asked to do some sketches (unfortunately, I didnât stay to see how it turned out). I always find it interesting to see how different people try to teach basic data visualization principles and though I found his slides hard to read, I think his â6 Principles of Information Designâ â borrowed from Edward Tufteâs âThe Visual Display of Quantitative Informationâ book â are well worth repeating::</p><p>Â </p><p>So, a little personal plug here. I spent the first part of my evening with about 70 other people doing a âPoster Fast Forwardâ, which was really fun. Each of us got up for 30 seconds to give a preview of our poster (mine is on the data visualization and infographic efforts at the Congressional Budget Office), which are being showcased in a neighboring room. I followed that up with an Ignite Talk (a 5 minute talk in which your 20 slides automatically advance every 15 seconds) at an event run by Noah Iliinski and sponsored by Tableau. A lot of people from the conference showed up and everyone seemed to have a good time.</p><p>Â </p><p>I freely admit that the academic side of data visualization is not my area of expertise. But I saw a number of different presentations today and here are some of the reported sample sizes in each: 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 5, 20, and 31. With such small samples sizes, I find it hard to believe the statistical results in any of these studies. I have to go to the back of my nearest statistics book to find the critical values of t-statistics when sample sizes are that small and I am almost entirely certain that none of these authors can claim that their samples were truly random. (Someone did try to point out that perhaps the respondents were randomly seated around the computersâthat doesnât count!) It also appears to be the case that many of the participants in these studies are students at the various universities at which these experiments are taking place. I just find it hard to think how results from studies using such small samples can be applied to the population at large. Even if cost is an issue, conclusive results should be based in good statistics, and such small sample sizes does not, to me, inspire confidence.</p><p>There looks to be a number of great talks tomorrow and Iâm excited to see what others are doing.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

Many thanks to Job for his efforts to keep us poor folk who arenât able to make it to this great flagship event.</em></p><p>Â </p><p>I started my morning by browsing the BioVis posters in the main hall. Reading some of those posters was like reading a foreign language; they are clearly written for the science community and not for the person interested in general data visualization. Iâm sure the tools, research, and research strategies are interesting, but they were not for me.</p><p>Okay, so onto my favorite part of my day and the reason why I came out a day earlier than I had originally planned: <a href=\"http://www.jeromecukier.net/\">Jerome Cukier</a>, <a href=\"http://vis.stanford.edu/\">Jeffrey Heer</a>, and <a href=\"http://alignedleft.com/\">Scott Murray</a> did a full-morning hands-on <em>d3 </em>training to a packed ballroom. (The tutorials and slides can all be found <a href=\"http://www.jeromecukier.net/blog/2012/10/15/d3-tutorial-at-visweek-2012/\">here </a>).</p><p>If youâre not familiar with d3, itâs an amazing tool that can do all sorts of great visualizations. (See these sites for more information: <a href=\"http://d3js.org/\">http://d3js.org/</a> and <a href=\"http://bost.ocks.org/mike/\">http://bost.ocks.org/mike/</a>). If you donât have programming experience in some of the standard web languagesâHTML, SVG, and CSS (and I donât)âgetting started in d3 can seem overwhelming, but the presenters did a great job of showing us how we only need the basics in those other packages to get going in d3.</p><p>I think the conceptual part of the talk got off to a great start with this slide from Jeff Heer:</p><p align=\"center\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6261\" title=\"VisWeek1\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VisWeek1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"447\"></p><p>In it, Jeff made the point that there are some tools (for example, Excel and Many Eyes) that can help us be efficient at creating data visualizations, but are lousy at allowing us to be expressive with the data. On the other side, there are tools that (for example, OpenGL and Processing) are not so good on the Efficiency side, but allow us to be more Expressive in choosing and creating chart types. The d3 toolkit, he argues, fits right into that sweet spot.</p><p>The rest of the morning was filled with a great step-by-step tutorial, led primarily by Scott and Jerome. A few months ago, I spent several intense weeks trying to learn d3 (and only survived because of occasional emails from Jerome and Scott), and many of the questions from the audience were exactly the sorts of things that tripped me up. The explanations from all three presenters were clear and immensely helpful. If youâre looking to get started with d3, these slides are the place the start.</p><p>Â </p><p>After a great lunch with Noah Iliinsky, I started my afternoon at one of the more academic-oriented research sessions. Okay, so I missed the mark on this oneâthese papers were out of my comfort zone and beyond me. Iâm sure they were informative to people who are familiar with the field, but I didnât get much out of them. The only thing I will say is that many of the slides were pretty badâlots of text, lots of bullets, and bad graphics. At the very least, I expected a higher level of presentation quality from a conference on <em>visualizing</em> information.</p><p>So I left that session and headed over to the <em>Connecting the DotsâShowing Relationship in Data &amp; Beyond </em>tutorial with Marc Streit, Hans-Joerg Schulz, and Alexander Lex. I missed a bit of Hansâ talk, but did get to see the other two tutorials and they were excellent, especially Alexanderâs. (Slides from the three talks can be found <a href=\"http://www.icg.tugraz.at/project/caleydo/projects-1/connecting-the-dots\">here</a>).</p><p>My favorite of the three was Alexanderâs talk on <em>how</em> to link data. As a very simple example, think about his tutorial as ways to best visualize subgroups within a scatterplot, though his lesson extends to all sorts of places where linking data is important. He went through three major classes of links:</p><p>1. Proximity: grouping/linking by placing entities in close proximity;</p><p align=\"center\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6266\" title=\"VisWeek2\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VisWeek2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"138\"></p><p>2. Similarity: adding a glyph, label, frame, or background;</p><p align=\"center\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6267\" title=\"VisWeek3\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VisWeek3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"170\"></p><p>a. Similarity could also involve blurring or darkening the background and not necessarily highlighting the variables of interest;</p><p align=\"center\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6268\" title=\"VisWeek4\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VisWeek4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"144\"></p><p>3. Connectedness: connected items with a line or curve or surround items with an outline, surface, or volume.</p><p align=\"center\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6269\" title=\"VisWeek5\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/VisWeek5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"164\"></p><p>He spent time discussing the pros and cons of each and in the end, it was Alexanderâs bottom-line takeaway that will stick with me: âConnectedness trumps everything else and can even be perceived faster than colorâ.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Back in August I shared <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/08/visualized-conference-new-york-8th-9th-november/\" target=\"_blank\">details</a> of the first ever âVisualizedâ conference. The event has been taking place in New York over the past couple of days and so I wanted to share some quick reflections from what has been a fantastic event.<br>\nÂ </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://visualized.com/#visualized\"><img src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Speakers.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Speakers\" width=\"640\" height=\"367\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6393\"></a></p><p>The thing that most attracted me about this event was a sense that it would offer a unique blend of different stories and design contexts. I prefer events that are going to introduce me to new ideas and inspirations, rather than being completely coterminous with my current experiences: a dominant feature of the <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/03/personal-reflections-on-malofiej-20/\" target=\"_blank\">Malofiej</a> conference I was part of and thoroughly enjoyed back in March. It felt like an ideal supplement to the successful <a href=\"http://eyeofestival.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eyeo Festival</a>.</p><p>It didnât disappoint. The variety and quality of work and ideas on show was terrific. Itâs fair to say the balance of work being showcased was probably more on the creative, emotive and abstract end of the spectrum rather than the pragmatic and analytical side, but I was hoping for that.</p><p>It wasnât just the quality of the speakers but the balance and the clustering of their talks. The <a href=\"http://visualized.com/agenda.php\" target=\"_blank\">agenda</a> for the day was very straightforward but ultimately one of its key attributes was the schedule, fixed around rapid 20 minute, single message presentations which was, for me, the optimum speed, duration and frequency. The organisers clearly helped to shape the content with a strong focus on ideas above pitching â very refreshing and welcome.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://visualized.com/agenda.php\"><img src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Agenda.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Agenda\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6394\"></a></p><p>Apart from missing a couple of the early talks, I did try to keep something of an account of the main themes and observations emerging from the day. Below is a <a href=\"http://www.storify.com/visualisingdata/tweets-from-visualized-conference\">storify</a> widget of my main tweets as Iâm sure you will want to relive them all over again! I would also recommend checking out the stream of Scientific Americanâs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChristiansenJen\" target=\"_blank\">Jen Christiansen</a> who did a great job of summarising the talks.</p><p><script src=\"//storify.com/visualisingdata/tweets-from-visualized-conference.js?template=slideshow\"></script><br>\n[<a href=\"//storify.com/visualisingdata/tweets-from-visualized-conference\" target=\"_blank\">View the story \"Tweets from @visualized conference\" on Storify</a>]</p><p>Despite the significant logistical challenge posed to the organisers, speakers and attendees, there was very little visible impact and this is to the credit of those working incredibly hard behind the scenes to keep everything visibly smooth. In total I would predict there were maybe 300+ attendees across the two days, its hard to say, but there werenât many empty seats, if that is a guide. Aside from the occasional technical challenge â an issue common to all events it seems â it was a perfect venue: the Times Center theatre was comfortable and ideally suited to such content. </p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Audience.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Audience\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6395\"></p><p>All in all a wonderful event. Great to meet so many new and old friends, a terrifically attentive, respectful and positive atmosphere. This is an event that I hope will continue to have a frequent presence on the conference event calendar.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

These are the main projects, events, new sites, trends, personalities and general observations that have struck me as being important to help further the development of this field.</p><p>Earlier this year I published <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/07/10-significant-visualisation-developments-january-to-june-2012/\" target=\"_blank\">this collection</a> for the first 6 months of 2012 and now Iâd like to mark the end of 2012 with my latest perspective.

Not a week seems to have gone by when he hasnât released a new awe-inspiring, mega-creative project, such as his <a href=\"http://intuitionanalytics.com/pleiades/\" target=\"_blank\">7 sets Venn Diagram</a> or <a href=\"http://intuitionanalytics.com/other/lostalgic/\" target=\"_blank\">Lostalgic</a>. Whatâs more, much of his work is based on complex subject matter, often highly computational, mathematical or qualitative in nature. An incredible few months for Santiago was topped off with a âpeopleâs choiceâ speakers slot at the <a href=\"http://visualized.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Visualized</a> conference where he received a fantastic standing ovation.</p><p>Â <br><a href=\"URL\" target=\"_blank\">2.

A joint collaboration between <a href=\"http://well-formed-data.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Moritz Stefaner</a>, <a href=\"http://nand.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Studio NAND</a>, and <a href=\"http://hemment.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Drew Hemment</a> and the team at and around <a href=\"http://futureeverything.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Future Everything</a>, this project aimed to capture and visualise the excitement and talking points around the Games based on large extracts of Twitter data. This stream of sentiment about different aspects of the Olympics was visually broadcast during the games using an innovative origami-style object which swarmed across the screen as new messages were posted about different topics. The sentiment from this huge dataset was constantly analysed and the key results shared and discussed via <a href=\"http://blog.emoto2012.org/\" target=\"_blank\">a dedicated blog</a>. At the end of the games a <a href=\"http://well-formed-data.net/archives/817/emoto-data-sculpture\" target=\"_blank\">data sculpture</a> was then created using 17 milled plates to exhibit the story of the sentiment around the games, one for each day, and an enormous wall-mounted timeline of the event in tweets. A truly staggering project and one that fundamentally succeeded.</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"http://graphics-info.blogspot.hk/\" target=\"_blank\">3.

He is the Graphics director at The South China Morning Post and is responsible for some of the best <a href=\"http://graphics-info.blogspot.hk/2012/12/messi-v-muller.html\" target=\"_blank\">static</a> and <a href=\"http://graphics-info.blogspot.hk/2012/11/wages-in-hong-kong.html\" target=\"_blank\">infographic</a> work Iâve seen this year. Naturally, the South China Morning Post doesnât command the same visibility on this side of the world, in comparison to the New York Times or The Guardian, but Simon has started his own <a href=\"http://graphics-info.blogspot.hk/\" target=\"_blank\">site</a> to profile the work being published out there and I strongly recommend you go through his portfolio and follow his updates.</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training/\" target=\"_blank\">4.

There appears to be a real appetite to learn about this subject now, perhaps a realisation that taste and instinct alone is not sufficient to create effective data visualisation work. Aside from my own <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training/\" target=\"_blank\">training courses</a>, as well as those of <a href=\"http://www.perceptualedge.com/courses.php\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Few</a> and <a href=\"http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/courses\" target=\"_blank\">Edward Tufte</a>, many other one-off workshops and courses have been run (<a href=\"http://www.bigdive.eu/program/\" target=\"_blank\">example 1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.densitydesign.org/2012/10/densitydesign-course-2013-tell-a-story-about-milano/\" target=\"_blank\">example 2</a>). Beyond the classroom format, the highest profile offering has come in the shape of Alberto Cairoâs <a href=\"http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2012/12/a-review-of-infographics-mooc.html\" target=\"_blank\">âIntroduction to Data Visualization and Infographicsâ MOOC</a> (Massive Open Online Course) which was extremely successful, with 2000 sign-ups for the first edition, and is already/nearly booked up for the <a href=\"http://open.journalismcourses.org/\" target=\"_blank\">second</a> being run in January. Read just one of the very positive reviews this course has received <a href=\"http://globalsociology.com/2012/12/09/the-mooc-experience/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. This is a very encouraging sign for the community, to see more and more practitioners wanting to educate themselves and enhance their skills can only be good news.</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"URL\" target=\"_blank\">5. Alberto Cairo</a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.thefunctionalart.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6535\" alt=\"AlbertoCairo\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/AlbertoCairo.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\"></a></p><p>â¦and speaking of Alberto, this guy has been the busiest man in the field this year and deserves recognition for this. He has translated and launched the English version of his book â<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Art-introduction-information-visualization/dp/0321834739\">The Functional Art</a>â (review coming soon when Iâve finished the last third!), heâs lecturing at the <a href=\"http://com.miami.edu/profile/Cairo,Alberto\" target=\"_blank\">University of Miami</a>, heâs designed and delivered the MOOC courses (and now facing another!), his quality and quantity of output on <a href=\"http://www.thefunctionalart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">his blog</a> is enough on its own, heâs one of the most active contributors on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/albertocairo\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and heâs found time to be a peer reviewer on my <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/book/\" target=\"_blank\">book</a> too. And he has a young child!</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20026367\" target=\"_blank\">6. Better Infographics?</a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20026367\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6557\" alt=\"Infographics\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Infographics.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\"></a></p><p>It seems 2012 was the year the flood of tower posters and generally bad infographics receded somewhat allowing the best work to be more visible. So, perhaps its less about <em>better</em> and more about easier access â less noise â but the infographics field seems a very different place than it did a year ago. Weâve seen some fantastic, authentic infographics this year from all the usual suspects (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Duenes/status/271261847292878848\" target=\"_blank\">NYT</a>, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/sandys-impact/2012/10/30/0f98c822-2307-11e2-ac85-e669876c6a24_graphic.html\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post</a>). There were also some nice examples of interactive infographics from the BBC (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20026367\" target=\"_blank\">James Bond</a>) and this one about <a href=\"http://www.angelamorelli.com/water/\" target=\"_blank\">Water</a>. From a personal viewpoint it was interesting to note that I had far fewer requests come in to publish infographics this year, maybe this has something to do with the impact of <a href=\"http://visual.ly/?view=explore\" target=\"_blank\">visual.ly</a> offering a natural home for such work?</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2012/nov/05/you-decide-the-presidential-election-interactive#CO,FL,IA,NV,NH,NC,OH,VA-CA,CT,IL,ME,MA,MI,MN,NJ,NM,NY,OR,PA,WA,WI,DE,DC,HI,MD,RI,VT-AZ,GA,MO,MT,AL,AK,AR,ID,IN,KS,KY,LA,MS,NE,ND,OK,SC,SD,TN,TX,UT,WV,WY\" target=\"_blank\">7.

As youâd expect, the <a href=\"http://blog.visual.ly/eight-different-takes-on-presidential-election-maps/\" target=\"_blank\">choropleth map</a> has had to run off into the woods to hibernate for the winter having been pushed to an inch of its survival but we did see some really innovative works. Perhaps the most celebrated was the New York Timeâs ingenious <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/02/us/politics/paths-to-the-white-house.html\" target=\"_blank\">512 Paths to the White House</a> but there was also a lot of love for the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2012/nov/05/you-decide-the-presidential-election-interactive\" target=\"_blank\">Guardian USâs âballoonsâ</a> visualisation, as well as many others. Of course, it doesnât need me to pick out the fact that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/17/nate-silver-interview-election-data-statistics?cat=world&amp;type=article\" target=\"_blank\">Nate Silver</a> was the undoubted star of the show and it will be fascinating to see what legacy his effect has on future US elections and those in other countries too.</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"http://data-cuisine.net/\" target=\"_blank\">8. Going beyond the visualâ¦</a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://data-cuisine.net/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6534\" alt=\"BeyondVisual\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/BeyondVisual.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"313\"></a></p><p>One of the interesting things Iâve picked up on during the past few months has been the creativity and innovation of experimentation as some people look to go beyond solely the visual representation of data using computers or illustration. Weâve had the <a href=\"http://data-cuisine.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Data Cuisine Workshop</a>, experiments such as <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/08/tasty-tweets-visual-representation-through-taste/\" target=\"_blank\">Tasty Tweets</a>, someÂ fascinatingÂ work by Onformative looking at the fusion of <a href=\"http://www.onformative.com/work/unnamed-soundsculpture/\" target=\"_blank\">dance, movement and sound</a>. We also saw the fun pieces like <a href=\"http://blog.visual.ly/pumpkin-pie-charts/\" target=\"_blank\">Pumpkin Pie Charts</a> and <a href=\"http://bindersfullofburgers.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Binders full of Burgers</a>. Iâm also intrigued by the potential of Kate McLeanâs <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-09/16/smell-maps\" target=\"_blank\">sensory maps</a>, mapping the smells, sounds and tastes of a city.</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"http://woodchanges.com/\" target=\"_blank\">9. Dimensional changes in wood</a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://woodchanges.com/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6540\" alt=\"Wood\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Wood.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"344\"></a></p><p>In theory, the temperature, humidity and dimensional changes of wood should be amongst the least accessible subjects (and frankly the more boring of topics) to the lay person but there is something so great about this project. Itâs elegant, has slick transitions and packs in so much comparable information into a very small space without ever feeling cluttered or overwhelming. The small multiples at the bottom of each graphic are fantastic summary devices and the whole thing just fits together into a really smart piece of work that should offer a blueprint if not just inspiration for those of you looking to make scientific information accessible.</p><p>Â </p><p><a href=\"http://neoformix.com/2012/DataVisFieldSubGroups.html\" target=\"_blank\">10. The Visualisation Community</a></p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://neoformix.com/2012/DataVisFieldSubGroups.html\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6543\" alt=\"DataVizFamily\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DataVizFamily.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\"></a></p><p>[Group hug] Finally, Iâm not alone in observing this but I do want to acknowledge what a terrific community the data visualisation and infographics world is. Maybe its because its an enjoyable and creative discipline but everyone is active, contributing and supporting each other with good humour and spirit. Twitter, in particular, is a very positive, accessible and welcoming community so if youâre not already on there, or are a silent observer, do get yourself involved because it is highly rewarding. So, hi-five to everybody on there because youâre a very nice bunch of people and thanks to all of you for making it a great field to be part of. [/Group hug]</p><p>Â </p><p><strong>Special mentionsâ¦</strong></p><p>Here are the other developments that deserve a warm round of applause having just missed out on the main top 10 list:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/07/20/us/drought-footprint.html\" target=\"_blank\">Slopegraphs and Small Multiples</a> â This is quite an instinctive sense more than anything concrete but I really have been struck by the number of times Iâve seen people discussing the use of Slopegraphs and Small Multiples. Maybe its because Iâm a massive fan of both these approaches that I have a particularly radar for their mention but I do believe we are hearing more about them and thatâs a good thing.</p><p><a href=\"http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2012/05/tornado-tracks.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tornado Tracker</a>Â -Â This is a bit of cheat given it was published in May but I only saw it in July so that makes it ok, ok? This was a really super project to track, initially, 56 years of tornados across the US, but as the project gained plenty of eye-balls it developed into a number of further versions with more data, up-to-date stories and interactive versions.</p><p><a href=\"http://hint.fm/wind/\" target=\"_blank\">Wind Map</a>Â -Â Weâve all seen and played with the Wind Map and it wasnât even launched during the past 6 months. However, that word âplayâ matured to the term âuseâ in recent months as powerful weather systems (Sandy, Isaac) battered parts of the US. People were actually using the visualisation (amongst others) to help them track the live story, which shows that works donât just exist as artefacts â they are being utilitised.</p><p><a href=\"http://postgraphics.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Graphics Blogs</a>Â -Â It was great to see the launch of dedicated gallery, collection and design narrative websites for both the <a href=\"http://postgraphics.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post</a> and <a href=\"http://juanvelascoblog.com/\" target=\"_blank\">National Geographic</a>, both very important organisations in the world of visualisation and infographics.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/08/the-wonderful-nyt-series-of-olympics-graphics/\" target=\"_blank\">NYT Olympics Series</a>Â -Â Of course you canât ignore the ongoing incredible work of the New York Times, which arguably moved up another level this year, particularly with the addition of Mike Bostock. The series of Olympics visualisations they did often within hours of the story or event happening were quite incredible with Joe Ward and <a href=\"http://www.grahaphics.com/The-High-Dive\" target=\"_blank\">Graham Roberts</a> at the fore of the best stuff.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/2012/11/reflections-from-visualized-conference/\" target=\"_blank\">Visualized Conference</a>Â -Â Iâve already spoken about this at length so I wonât rehearse the same points other than to say this was a fantastic two day event, packed full of inspirational and impressive talks and speakers and I sincerely hope it continues in 2013.</p><p><a href=\"http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/dynamic/app/\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Polar Bear</a>Â -Â Finally, I often find myself included bear-related projects, but I loved this project that investigated the population and habitat of polar bears.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Iâm delighted to announce that my book â<a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/data-visualization-a-successful-design-process/book\">Data Visualization: A Successful Design Process</a>â has finally been completed and is now ready to be published!</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/data-visualization-a-successful-design-process/book\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6186\" title=\"BookCover\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/BookCover.jpeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"617\"></a></p><p>I was approached in January 2012 by an Acquisitions Editor from <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">Packt Publishing</a> to develop an 80 to 90 page eBook on the subject of data visualisation and, specifically, about the process of designing a data visualisation. Packt are apparently one of the most prolific and fast-growing tech book publishers and their business model is digitally-focused (not just in terms of subject matter but also their focus on electronic publication).</p><p>Over the course of writing the book over the past few months it has grown and grown in size (large through my own coverage-creep!) and now exists as a 206 page eBook and printed book.</p><p>You will learn more about the structure and content of the book below but it is worth saying that this material is very complementary to my <a href=\"http://www.visualisingdata.com/index.php/training/\" target=\"_blank\">data visualisation training courses</a> and inn many ways they have informed each other.</p><p>I was immensely fortunate to have secured the input of <a href=\"http://www.thefunctionalart.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alberto Cairo</a>, <a href=\"http://dataremixed.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Jones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jeromecukier.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Jerome Cukier</a> and <a href=\"http://moebio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Santiago Ortiz</a> as my esteemed peer reviewers and their feedback was highly valued and advice extremely welcome.</p><p>It is scheduled to be published on <strong>28th December</strong> and will be available, of course, from Packtâs own <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/data-visualization-a-successful-design-process/book\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> as well as Amazon (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1849693463/?tag=packtpubli-20\" target=\"_blank\">.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1849693463/?tag=packtpubli-21\" target=\"_blank\">.co.uk</a> etc.) and <a href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/?keyword=Data+Visualization%3A+a+successful+design+process\" target=\"_blank\">Barnes &amp; Noble</a>, amongst others. You should expect to get the best deal direct from <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/data-visualization-a-successful-design-process/book\" target=\"_blank\">Packtâs site</a>. I expect the option to pre-order will be available in the next day or two.</p><p>(Note that the details and prices currently shown on these various sites is months out of date and is awaiting a final update in the next 24 hours).</p><p>Â </p><p>Welcome to the craft of data visualisation: a multi-disciplinary recipe of art, science, math, technology and many other interesting ingredients. Not too long ago we might have associated charting or graphing data as a specialist or fringe activity: it was something that scientists, engineers and statisticians did.</p><p>Nowadays, the analysis and presentation of data is a mainstream pursuit. Yet, very few of us have been taught how to do these types of tasks well. Taste and instinct normally prove to be reliable guiding principles but they arenât sufficient alone to effectively and efficiently navigate through all the different challenges we face and the choices we have to make.</p><p>This book offers a handy strategy guide to help you approach your dataÂ visualisationÂ work with greater know-how and increased confidence. It is a practical book structured around a proven methodology that will equip you with the knowledge, skills and resources required to make sense of data, to find stories and to tell stories from your data.</p><p>It will provide you with a comprehensive framework of concerns, presenting step-by-step all the things you have to think about, advising you when to think about them and guiding you through how to decide what to do about them.</p><p>Once you have worked through this book you will be able to tackle any project â big, small, simple, complex, individual, collaborative, one-off or regular â with an assurance that you have all the tactics and guidance needed to deliver the best results possible.</p><p>Â </p><p>Regardless of whether you are an experienced visualizer or a rookie just starting out, this book should provide useful and practical guidance to anyone who is looking to learn about data visualisation design and/or wants to optimise his or her techniques.</p><p>If you are satisfied with the effectiveness and efficiency of your design approach, it may not be for you. Likewise, if you are looking for deep levels of theory, software/code tutorials, or coffee-table glossy galleries, once again, this isnât the book for you.</p><p>The aim is for it to be something for everyone: you might be coming into data visualization as a designer and want to bolster your data skills, you might be strong analytically but want inspiration for the design side of things, you might have a great nose for a story but donât quite possess the means for handling or executing a data driven design.</p><p>Furthermore, you may never actually fulfill the role of a designer and might have other interests in learning about data visualization. You may be commissioning work or coordinating a project team and want to know how to successfully handle and evaluate a design process.</p><p>Hopefully, it will inform and inspire all who wish to get involved in data visualization design work regardless of role, background or expertise.</p><p>You donât need to be a gifted polymath to get the most out of this book but ideally you will have reasonable computer skills (software and programming), have a good basis in mathematics, and statistics, in particular, and have a good design instinct.</p><p>There are many other facets that will of course be advantageous but the most important trait is just having a natural creativity and curiosity to use data as a means of unlocking insights and communicating stories. These will be key to getting the maximum benefit from this text.</p><p>You cannot become skilled by reading this book alone, so you need to have a realistic perspective about the journey you are taking and the distance you have made already. As with most skills in life that are worth pursuing, to become a capable data visualization practitioner takes time, patience and practice. However, through applying the techniques presented, then learning and developing from your experiences, you will enjoy a continued and successful process of improvement.</p><p>Â </p><p><strong>1. The Context of Data Visualization (21 pages)</strong><br>\nChapter 1 provides an introduction to the subject, its value and relevance today, including some foundation understanding around the theoretical and practical basis of data visualization. This chapter introduces the data visualization methodology and the step-by-step approach recommended to achieve effective and efficient designs. We finish off with a discussion about some of the fundamental design objectives that provide a valuable reference for the suitability of the choices we subsequently make.</p><p><strong>2. Setting the Purpose and Identifying Key Factors (23)</strong><br>\nChapter 2 launches the methodology with the first stage concerned with the vital task of identifying the purpose of your visualization: what is its reason for existing and what is its intended effect? We will look closely at the definition of a visualizationâs function and its tone in order to shape our design decision-making at the earliest possible opportunity. To complete this scoping stage we will identify and assess the impact of other key factors that will have an effect on your project. We will pay particularly close attention to the skills, knowledge and general capabilities that are necessary to accomplish an effective visualization solution.</p><p><strong>3. Demonstrating Editorial Focus and Learning About Your Data (26)</strong><br>\nChapter 3 looks at the intertwining issues of the data weâre working with and the stories we aim to extract and present. We will look at the importance of demonstrating editorial focus around what it is we are trying to say and then work through the most time-consuming aspect of any data visualization project: the preparation of data. To cement the learning in this chapter we will look at an example of how we use visualization methods to find and tell stories.</p><p><strong>4. Conceiving and Reasoning Visualization Design Options (39)</strong><br>\nChapter 4 takes us beyond the vital preparatory and scoping stages of the methodology and towards the design issues involved in establishing an effective visualization solution. This is arguably the focal point of the book as we look to identify all the design options we have to consider and what choices to make. We will work through this stage by forensically analyzing the anatomy of a visualization design, separating our challenge into the complementary dimensions of the representation and presentation of data.</p><p><strong>5. Taxonomy of Data Visualization Methods (40)</strong><br>\nChapter 5 goes hand-in-hand with the previous chapter as it explores the taxonomy of data visualization methods as defined by the primary communication purpose. Within this chapter we will see an organized collection of some of the most common chart types and graphical methods being used that will provide you with a gallery of ideas to apply to your own projects.</p><p><strong>6. Constructing and Evaluating Your Design Solution (23)</strong><br>\nChapter 6 concludes the methodology by focusing on the final tasks involved in constructing your solution. This chapter will outline a selection of the most common and useful software applications and programming environments. It will present some of the key issues to think about when testing, finishing and launching a design solution as well as the important matter of evaluating the success of your project post-launch. Finally, the book comes to a close by sharing some of the best ways for you to continue to learn, develop, and refine your data visualization design skills.</p><p>Â </p><p>As I said above, the eBook was the primary intended format but the print option emerged as an additional development during the course of writing it. Just so any potential buyer is completely informed about their purchase, please note that, whilst the eBook is produced in full colour, the printed book is published in black and white.</p><p>As far as I am aware no Packt title is available in colour in the printed version so this is standard practice for them and many other publishing houses as they content with the costs of printing and handle the transition of the industry towards a print and digital platform mix.</p><p>Of course a printed book about data visualisation would ideally be available in full colour but the benefit to the customer is that the price of the book is reduced quite significantly. Packt have created an <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/data-visualization-a-successful-design-process/book\" target=\"_blank\">attractive bundle</a> option that allows you to buy both eBook and print book for a very reasonable sub-Â£20 (sub-$30) price. If you can stretch that far, I would recommend that as the best option.</p><p>Â </p><p>I know a number of people who have generously stated they will be buying the book as soon as it comes out and it will be a recurring pleasant surprise to hear of anyone who does spend their hard-earned money on my book. I will be immensely grateful for anyone who does this so please allow me to thank you in advance, if I donât get chance to do so in person or electronically at the time!</p><p>Finally, as the publishing progresses over the next few days I will be inviting peers across the field to read and review the book. More information will be sent out in due course.</p><p>Related posts:</p>\n",
