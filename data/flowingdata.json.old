The map reveals the checkerboard patterns of logging in the old growth of the Pacific Northwest and the highly managed tree farms of the Southeast. In the Midwest, trees outline the rivers and the edges between farms, while forests re-emerge on land that was once cleared for crops. In the Mid-Atlantic and New England, lands that were stripped bare in the early years of the nation are now tree-covered again—though with many urban developments amidst the forest.</p></blockquote>\n<p>[<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/ForestCarbon/page4.php');\" href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/ForestCarbon/page4.php\">NASA</a> | Thanks, Michael]</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

So in a way, these items are connected by how people buy. Artist and designer Christopher Warnow uses the metaphor to create a network of Amazon products, where each node represents an item, and connections, or edges, represent common bonds of recommendations. Simply enter an Amazon link, and Warnow's software generates a network.<br><span id=\"more-20983\"></span></p>\n<p>For example, the image above is the network for Edward Tufte's <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/?tag=flowingdata-20');\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/?tag=flowingdata-20\">Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a>, although Stephen Few's <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-Effective-Communication/dp/0596100167/?tag=flowingdata-20');\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-Effective-Communication/dp/0596100167/?tag=flowingdata-20\">Information Dashboard Design</a> seems to have more connections for some reason. My quick guess is that book's that are less niche have more connections, because when I entered Visualize This, the network was pretty small.

The study found that when someone marries, he or she is more likely to start buying a new type of coffee. When a couple move into a new house, they're more apt to purchase a different kind of cereal. When they divorce, there’s an increased chance they'll start buying different brands of beer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>These findings <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html');\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html\">turned out to be the backbone</a> of work by statistician Andrew Pole, who was hired by Target to analyze their data and increase sales. Somewhere along the way, the marketing department at Target asked Pole if there was a way to predict that a customer was expecting a child. Birth records are freely available, so it's easy to send baby-related coupons and advertisements to new mothers, but Target wanted first dibs, before that baby came out. </p>\n<p>As you might expect, Pole found 25 products that were strong indicators and soon he had an estimate of pregnancies with a pregnancy prediction score.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pole applied his program to every regular female shopper in Target's national database and soon had a list of tens of thousands of women who were most likely pregnant. If they could entice those women or their husbands to visit Target and buy baby-related products, the company’s cue-routine-reward calculators could kick in and start pushing them to buy groceries, bathing suits, toys and clothing, as well. When Pole shared his list with the marketers, he said, they were ecstatic. Soon, Pole was getting invited to meetings above his paygrade. Eventually his paygrade went up.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Creepy or just good marketing? I say the latter.</p>\n<p>[<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html');\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html\">New York Times</a> | Thanks, <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.skunkwrkz.net/');\" href=\"http://www.skunkwrkz.net/\">Paul</a>]</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

This turns accessibility on its head: Readers must work to discern which conclusions are fully quantitative, which are somewhat data driven and which are purely speculative.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fung and Gelman then cite examples that they believe erroneous.</p>\n<p>It's not mean-spirited, but Gelman has a way of <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2011/08/15/statistical-graphics-and-information-visualization/\">offending</a> even if he doesn't mean to, so I knew a third of the way through that this could not end well.</p>\n<p><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.freakonomics.com/2012/03/20/freakonomics-what-went-right-responding-to-wrong-headed-attacks/');\" href=\"http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/03/20/freakonomics-what-went-right-responding-to-wrong-headed-attacks/\">Dubner replied</a>. (Skip part II, which addresses a different issue that shouldn't have been an issue in the first place.) He assesses — after explaining why almost everything that Fung and Gelman wrote is wrong — that they were blinded by their want to disprove.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[O]nce they'd picked up a hammer, did everything look like a nail?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dubner continues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I can certainly understand why Freakonomics is an appealing target for someone like Gelman-Fung. As I noted earlier, there are strong incentives to attack, particularly in the public sphere, where one can get a ton of attention in a blink by assailing the reputation of someone who's been plugging away for years. Whether in the academy, the media, the political arena, or elsewhere, public discourse these days often seems little more than a tit-for-tat game in which you wait for someone or something to achieve a certain momentum and then shout as loudly as you can that it’s \"wrong!\" Or, in written form: <em>Epic fail</em>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I've only read the first book, which like I said was really good, so I can't really go with either side, but Dubner provides some compelling arguments, and I have a feeling most people will believe him more.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Gelman <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/andrewgelman.com/2012/03/a-kaleidoscope-of-responses-to-dubners-criticisms-of-our-criticisms-of-freaknomics/');\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2012/03/a-kaleidoscope-of-responses-to-dubners-criticisms-of-our-criticisms-of-freaknomics/\">replies to the reply</a> and Fung <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/2012/03/what-can-we-learn-from-freakonomics.html');\" href=\"http://junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/2012/03/what-can-we-learn-from-freakonomics.html\">adds to that</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

For example, some players are now labeled \"point-forwards\" or \"combo-guards.\" But what if we were wrong about our initial five positions. Maybe a \"Center\" is just a label for people over a certain height, and there are actually three different types of big men in the NBA.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An analysis, done with data exploration tool <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.ayasdi.com/index.php/iris/');\" href=\"http://www.ayasdi.com/index.php/iris/\">Ayasdi Iris</a>, provided 13 possible positions, as shown above. Nodes and edges are colored by points per minute on a blue (low) to red (high) scale. </p>\n<p>So for example, those typically classified as centers or power forwards are classified as scoring rebounders, paint protectors, and scoring paint protectors. Dirk Nowitzki might be considered a scoring rebounder, whereas Joakim Noah is a paint protector.</p>\n<p>The point? Hopefully teams can use this information to make better decisions about who to trade and draft. Of course, I'm sure scouts know about these fuzzy positions already, so I think the next step is to look at what positions the best teams have and had, and more importantly, how a \"one-of-a-kind\" player can change everything.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

However, a couple of months ago, <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/enrico.bertini.me/');\" href=\"http://enrico.bertini.me/\">Enrico Bertini</a> and <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/moritz.stefaner.eu/');\" href=\"http://moritz.stefaner.eu/\">Moritz Stefaner</a> started <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/datastori.es/');\" href=\"http://datastori.es/\">Data Stories, a podcast on visualization</a>. Enrico is a researcher in the area and Moritz is more of a practitioner, so it's a good contrast between the two.</p>\n<p>Neither had experience producing podcasts before this, so it was rough around the edges at first. But each episode has been getting better. I highly recommend it.</p>\n<p>In the most recent episode, with <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/visualisingdata.com/');\" href=\"http://visualisingdata.com/\">Andy Kirk</a>, they discuss the most common question from people new to the field: how to get started. <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/datastori.es/episode-5-how-to-learn-data-visualization-with-andy-kirk/');\" href=\"http://datastori.es/episode-5-how-to-learn-data-visualization-with-andy-kirk/\">Go ahead and listen</a>. It's a good one if you're itching to get your feet wet.</p>\n<p>One thing I'd add (that maybe I missed as cars drove past me) is that it's important to establish what you want to learn visualization for. The purpose will change what methods to use and what software to learn.

This was after seeing <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/narrowthegapp.com/');\" href=\"http://narrowthegapp.com/\">Narrow the Gapp</a> by Gina Trapani and then a Time Magazine cover story on how more women are becoming the main earners of households.

My idea was to combine the two as a recreation of the latter, with a couple of my own interactions. I went to work on a bunch of horrible government PDFs and then pulled it all together.</p>\n<p>(I was mostly interested in what the data looked like. I was hoping to see a counterclockwise turn towards the equal pay gap line, but of course, it's never that simple.)</p>\n<p>At some time late at night, I put up <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/projects.flowingdata.com/salary/');\" href=\"http://projects.flowingdata.com/salary/\">the graphic</a> and hastily <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2012/04/13/gender-wage-gap-how-much-less-women-make-than-men/\">posted</a> about it. I wrote in the footer of the graphic that it was an update to the NYT version that made use of Mike's D3 and left it at that. And that was fine. There were some good comments, and I was happy that Graham and Hannah <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/twitter.com/#!/Grahaphics/status/192006600767188993');\" href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/Grahaphics/status/192006600767188993\">shared</a> it on Twitter.</p>\n<p>But then there was confusion when my graphic went up on CNNMoney a few days later without a nod to NYT. That's when I got my first taste of online bitter. It tastes bad, and it's kind of scary how quick people are to think the worst.</p>\n<p>However, it was an honest mistake by both CNNMoney and me. They didn't catch the note in the footer, so they didn't realize I had recreated the NYT graphic. They were quick to act when they found out though, so good on them. </p>\n<p>As for me, I live in a bubble where I share whatever I want on FlowingData and all the <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/category/projects/\">mini-projects</a> I work on simply come out of my own curiosities. I didn't even think about possible conflicts when I was asked if it was okay to share the graphic. We did something similar with the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/projects.flowingdata.com/walmart/');\" href=\"http://projects.flowingdata.com/walmart/\">Walmart map</a> a while back, and the contrast between comments from CNN's general audience and FlowingData's was fun to see. So I just said sure. I should have thought a little harder. </p>\n<p>Anyways, I've learned my lesson. I'll make recreations more clear — if I do them at all at this point — and no more hasty posts late at night.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

I sometimes forget that HCIL focuses on things other than visualization, so I had to sit, confused, through a few talks before I realized they weren't about visualization (\"Where's the viz?\" I was thinking).

If you're more adventurous, you snorkel or go deep sea diving. Even then you don't swim the entire ocean right away. You explore a little bit at a time. You chip away at the database a little bit at a time, and what you learn during one dive carries over to the next. Sure, people drown in the ocean, but the good news is that when you drown in data, you still get more chances to learn and try again.</p>\n<p>You don't even have to go to the ocean right away. Although they're small, ponds and lakes can be interesting too. (Think hyperlocal.)

Better yet, become a greenhorn with the best captain you can find and learn the subtleties of the sea.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, more data means more opportunity, and if you know how to doggy paddle, you're going to be okay. Know how to do more than that? All the better.

It is not unimaginable wealth. It is a very modest £12 706.60 per person per raid. Indeed, it is so low that it is not worth the banks’ while to spend as little as £4500 per cashier position at every branch on rising screens to deter them.</p>\n<p>A single bank raid, even a successful one, is not going to keep our would-be robber in a life of luxury. It is not going to keep him long in a life of any kind. Given that the average UK wage for those in full-time employment is around £26 000, it will give him a modest lifestyle for no more than 6 months. If he decides to make a career of it, and robs two banks a year to make a sub-average income, his chances of eventually getting caught will increase: at 0.8 probability per raid, after three raids or a year and a half his odds of remaining at large are 0.8×0.8×0.8=0.512; after four raids he is more likely than not to be inside. As a profitable occupation, bank robbery leaves a lot to be desired.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Be sure to read the full article for more details on the varying gains and losses when the team is bigger and whether or not a gun is used. Spoiler: an additional member to the robbing team raises the expected haul by about £9,000, and the use of a firearm raises the expected output by about £10,000. Just don't get arrested.</p>\n<p>[via <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/arstechnica.com/science/2012/06/economists-demonstrate-exactly-why-bank-robbery-is-a-bad-idea/');\" href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/06/economists-demonstrate-exactly-why-bank-robbery-is-a-bad-idea/\">Ars Technica</a>]</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

Emoto, a team effort by Drew Hemment, Moritz Stefaner, and Studio NAND, is <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/emoto2012.org/');\" href=\"http://emoto2012.org/\">a Twitter tracker that aggregates sentiment around topics</a>.<br><span id=\"more-26191\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>We search twitter for general terms related to the Olympics. Within these search results, we look for individual topics, like athletes, disciplines, venues, or also general topics like \"traffic\" or \"suprise\". Then, the text of each tweet is analysed for emotional words using the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.lexalytics.com/');\" href=\"http://www.lexalytics.com/\">lexalytics software</a>, resulting in a sentiment score ranging from -6 (very negative) over 0 (neutral) to 6 (very positive). As this project is about mapping emotions, our visualisation uses only tweets which can be assigned a sentiment value.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In line with the London 2012 logo, Emoto pieces together triangles to show this sentiment. The top yellow triangle indicates a very positive tweet, whereas a dark blue triangle far to the bottom indicates a very negative tweet. The triangles in between indicate sentiment scores in the middle, and the triangles are sized by the number of tweets that day.</p>\n<p>There's a view that lets you passively watch tweets as they come in live, which will be fun to see when something significant happens, but it'll probably get most interesting when you can compare over time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/olympic-topic-history-625x401.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"olympic topic history\" width=\"625\" height=\"401\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-26197\"></p>\n<p>I'm sure there's some skepticism about the triangles over everyone's favorite bar graphs, but there's so much fuzziness in tweet sentiment analysis that I don't think it matters that much.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

Last time we tuned in, swimsuit technology had progressed so far that human torpedos in rubber suits set new marks almost hourly in Beijing, particularly in shorter events. But times got slower after the suits were banned in 2010, and only one \"shiny suit\" record has been broken since then in an individual event of 400 meters or less.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They use a swimming pool metaphor, with the horizontal axis as time, and the vertical axis as the number of seconds shaved off from standing records pre-1998. Each dot represents a broken record, and the gray paths, for each event, indicate how long each record stood for. So when you press play, paths are drawn left to right, top to bottom, and black dots pop up for every new record.</p>\n<p>As a standalone animation, the base of this graphic would be fun to watch, but there's a layer of context and interaction that makes it more interesting.</p>\n<p>The illustrations on top provide direction and focus, whereas without them, it'd look a lot like a standard timeline. With them, you get a instant sense of what you're looking at.</p>\n<p>Then when you first press play, the animation pauses at 1996 to give you a short explanation of what you just saw. Click to continue, and labels popup and fade on major events, which serves as a quick explanation of why there were so many broken records all at once.</p>\n<p>Finally, once the animation completes, you can use the tabs on the left to highlight paths for specific events. The best time is shown at the end of the path. The only thing left to do is to provide information for each dot (like who the swimmer is), but the focus here is on the patterns of the suit rather than the individual swimmers, so no biggie. Actually, it's probably better without. Really like this one.</p>\n<p>[via @<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/twitter.com/eschow/status/228509394369929217');\" href=\"https://twitter.com/eschow/status/228509394369929217\">eschow</a>]</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

If, however, the name \"statistician\" is avoided because that connotes not <em>a powerful discipline which transforms profound ideas about learning from experience into practical tools</em>, but rather, <em>a meaningless conglomeration of rituals better conducted with twenty-sided dice</em>, then we as a profession have failed ourselves and, more importantly, the public, and the blame lies with us.

There are examples with the software, so you can get a feel for how everything fits together. You can also export your results as an image file or as SVG to edit in your favorite vector-editing software.

They should have the freedom to experiment and explore possibilities. That said, they need close relationships with the rest of the business. The most important ties for them to forge are with executives in charge of products and services rather than with people overseeing business functions. As the story of Jonathan Goldman illustrates, their greatest opportunity to add value is not in creating reports or presentations for senior executives but in innovating with customer-facing products and processes.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I still call myself a statistician. The main difference between data scientist and statistician seems to be programming skills, but if you're doing statistics without code, I'm not sure what you're doing (other than theory).</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> This recent panel from DataGotham also discusses the data scientist hiring process.

(I don't think Alberto remembers, but what seems like many years ago, I sat right behind him for two weeks at the New York Times when they brought him in to help illustrate <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/08/25/sports/tennis/20070827_NADAL_GRAPHIC.html');\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/08/25/sports/tennis/20070827_NADAL_GRAPHIC.html\">Raphael Nadal's approach to tennis</a>.) </p>\n<p>His experience is hugely important in making the book work. There's a growing number of books on information graphics, and many are written and illustrated by people who don't have much experience displaying information, which leads to art books posing as something else. This isn't one of those books. Cairo knows what he's talking about.</p>\n<p>As you flip through, you'll notice a lot of examples, with a focus on process and even a handful of pencil sketches. The last third of the book is interviews with those well-established in the field, which also walks you through how some graphics were made. There's a strong undertone of finding the balance between function (e.g. efficiency and accuracy) and engagement (e.g. use of circles).</p>\n<p>Cairo comes from a journalism background, so the book is mostly in the context of presentation, but there's of course plenty that you can apply to more exploratory graphics. I would say though that Cairo's strength is in illustration and information, and so the book reflects that. This isn't a book that covers visual data analysis or statistical concepts, but it is one that explores and describes the making of high quality information graphics that lend clarity to concepts and ideas. If you're looking for the latter, <em>The Functional Art</em> is worth your time.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.peachpit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321834739');\" href=\"http://www.peachpit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321834739\">sample chapter</a> on the publisher page, but then <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.amazon.com/Functional-Art-introduction-information-visualization/dp/0321834739/?tag=flowingdata-20');\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Art-introduction-information-visualization/dp/0321834739/?tag=flowingdata-20\">grab it on Amazon</a> and save a few bucks.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

But it turns out it is actually a pretty important thing to know and relevant to those of us on the East Coast right now.

That's a huge change from the old days, when bags were dropped into the \"black box\" of a manually sorted baggage system. But crucially, an ABT doesn't just contain a bar code—it's also custom-printed with your name, flight details, and destination. That made the global implementation of ABTs much easier, because early-adopters could introduce them long before every airport was ready—a huge advantage when it comes to seamlessly connecting the world's least and most advanced airports. And of course, ABTs can still be read manually when systems break down.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It's funny how something so commonplace like a sticky loop label goes through these iterations. There are people behind these things who think about the ins and outs of how something works, no matter how small they might seem, so that we don't have to.

Triangles in each country represent programs and are colored by the three above categories, and you might recognize Moritz' <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2010/05/26/elastic-lists-code-open-sourced/\">elastic lists</a> in the sidebar to filter through programs, by country, organization, and type.

The app works by sending your uploaded track over to <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/developer.echonest.com/');\" href=\"http://developer.echonest.com/\">The Echo Nest</a>, where it is decomposed into individual beats. Each beat is then analyzed and matched to other similar sounding beats in the song. This information is used to create a detailed song graph of paths though similar sounding beats. As the song is played, when the next beat has similar sounding beats there’s a chance that we will branch to a completely different part of the song. Since the branching is to a very similar sounding beat in the song, you (in theory) won’t notice the jump. This process of branching to similar sounding beats can continue forever, giving you an infinitely long version of the song.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

    "title": "Getting Started with Charts in R",
    "meta": "",
    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>So you want to make some charts in R, but you don't know where to begin. This straightforward tutorial should teach you the basics, and give you a good idea of what you want to do next.<br><span id=\"more-27945\"></span></p>\n<h2>Install R</h2>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">I know, I know, the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/r-project.org');\" href=\"http://r-project.org\">R homepage</a> looks horrible, but just ignore that part.</span>Of course, you need to actually have R installed and running on you computer before you do anything. You can download R for Windows, OS X, or Linux <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/cran.stat.ucla.edu/');\" href=\"http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/\">here</a>. For Windows, download the base and the latest version. It's a .exe file and quick installation. For OS X, download the latest .pkg, which is also a one-click install. For the Linux folk, I'll leave you to your own devices.</p>\n<h2>Loading and handling data</h2>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">A <em>function</em> is a way to tell the computer what to do. The <code>c()</code> function is short for \"combine\" so you essentially tell the computer (in the R language) to combine the values.</span>You have to load and be able to handle data before you can chart it. No data means no chart. Enter the <em>vector</em>. It's a structure in R that you use to store data, and you use it often. Use the <code>c()</code> function to create one, as shown in the line of code below. (Hopefully, you've opened R by now. Enter this in the window that opened up aka the <em>console</em>.)</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Vector\r\nc(1,2,3,4,5)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Imagine that the values 1 through 5 are data points that you want to access later. When you enter the above, you create a vector of values, and it's just sort of gone. To save it for later, assign the vector to a <em>variable</em>.</p>\n<p><code></code></p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Assign to variable\r\nfakedata &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this example, the variable name is \"fakedata.\" Now if you want to access the first value in the fakedata vector, use the syntax below where 1 is the <em>index</em>. You get back the value in that spot in the vector. Try using other indicies and see what values come up.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Access a value from vector\r\nfakedata[1]\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Did you try using an index greater than five? That would give you an \"NA\" value, which is R's way of saying that there's nothing in that place (because the vector only has a length of five).</p>\n<p>Create another vector, <code>morefake</code>, of all a's. Notice the quotes around the a's to indicate that those are <em>characters</em> and not variables and that this new vector is of the same length as <code>fakedata</code>. Then use the <code>cbind()</code> function to combine the two to see what you get.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Matrix, values converted to characters\r\nmorefake &lt;- c(\"a\", \"a\", \"a\", \"a\", \"a\")\r\ncbind(fakedata, morefake)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>When you combine the two vectors, you get a <em>matrix</em> with two columns and five rows. The numbers have quotes around them too now, because a matrix can only have one data type. The <code>fakedata</code> vector has numeric values and again, the <code>morefake</code> vector has all character values.</p>\n<p>However, in many cases (as you'll see soon), you want a structure that has all your values, but with columns of different data types. The <em>data frame</em> in R lets you do this, and it's where most of your CSV-formatted data will go. Create a data frame from multiple vectors as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nfake.df &lt;- data.frame(cbind(fakedata, morefake))\r\nfake.df$morefake &lt;- as.character(fake.df$morefake)\r\ncolnames(fake.df)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>You use <code>cbind()</code> again to combine the vectors, and then pass the resulting matrix to <code>data.frame()</code>. Then convert the column that contains <code>morefake</code> values back to characters. </p>\n<p>The dollar sign ($) syntax is important here. The data frame is assigned to the variable <code>fake.df</code>. The column names are automatically assigned the variable names of the vectors, so to access the <code>morefake</code> column, follow the data frame variable, <code>fake.df</code>, with a dollar sign and the column name.</p>\n<h3>Loading a CSV file</h3>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">The CSV file is included in the downloadable source linked at the beginning of this tutorial. Be sure to set your working directory in R to the directory where the file is via the Misc &gt; Change Working Directory... menu.</span>With data frame and vectors in mind, load \"2009education.csv\" with <code>read.csv()</code>. The data is assigned to the <code>education</code> variable as a data frame, so you can access rows and columns using index values. However, unlike the vector, the data frame is two-dimensional (rows and columns), so use two indices separated with a comma. The first index is the row number, and the second is the column number.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\neducation &lt;- read.csv(\"2009education.csv\", header=TRUE, sep=\",\", as.is=TRUE)\r\neducation[1,]\t\t# First row\r\neducation[1:10,]\t# First ten rows\r\neducation$state\t\t# First columnn\r\neducation[,1]\t\t# Also first column\r\neducation[1,1]\t\t# First cell\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>The data are US state estimates for people with at least high school degrees, bachelors, or higher — one column for each education level.</p>\n<p>It's often useful to sort rows by a certain column. For example, you can sort states by the percentage of people with at least high school diplomas, least to greatest, using the <code>order()</code> function. The function gives you a vector of indices, which you pass to the <code>education</code> data frame and assign to <code>education.high</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Sort least to greatest\r\nhigh.order &lt;- order(education$high)\t\t\t\r\neducation.high &lt;- education[high.order,]\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Similarly, you can order from greatest to least by setting decreasing to TRUE in <code>order()</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Sort greatest to least\r\nhigh.order &lt;- order(education$high, decreasing=TRUE)\r\neducation.high &lt;- education[high.order,]\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Okay, you got the data. On to charts. </p>\n<h2>Basic plotting</h2>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">It's not <em>that</em> smart though. But at least it won't crash on you.</span>R has a <code>plot()</code> function that is kind of smart in that it adapts to the data that you pass it. For example, plot <code>fakedata</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(fakedata)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's only a one-dimensional vector, so by default, R uses a dot plot with the values of the vector on the vertical axis and indices on the horizontal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.30.54-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Dot plot and fake data\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28027\"></p>\n<p>However, try to plot the education data frame, as shown below, and you get an error.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(education)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>The <code>plot()</code> function gets mixed up, because it doesn't know what to do with the first column, which is state names, and the other columns which are numeric values. What if you plot just one column?</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(education.high$high)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.38.05-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Scatter plot\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28025\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">This shouldn't surprise you, because when you passed <code>education.high$high</code> to <code>plot()</code>, you gave it a vector, just like in the <code>fakedata</code> example.</span>As you might expect, you get a dot plot, where each dot represents a state. Again, indicies are on the horizontal, and high school estimates are on the vertical.</p>\n<p>Want a scatter plot with high school on the horizontal and bachelors on the vertical? Pass <code>plot()</code> both columns of data.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(education$high, education$bs)\r\nplot(education[,2:3])\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>The two lines of code above give you same plot. What if you pass three columns?</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Passing multiple columns\r\nplot(education[,2:4])\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>You get a scatter plot matrix. The bachelor degree and advanced degree rates are strongly correlated.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.42.44-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Scatter plot matrix\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28024\"></p>\n<h2>Using arguments</h2>\n<p>When you pass different valus to functions, you actually set the value of arguments. Change the values, and you get different output and charts. For example, the <code>plot()</code> function has a <code>type</code> argument, which use to specify the type of chart you want. If you don't specify, R will guess and use dots by default.</p>\n<p>Set type to \"l\" and you get a line chart.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Line\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"l\")\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">You would never use a line chart for this particular dataset, but for the sake of simplicity, let's pretend that it's useful.</span><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.43.10-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Line chart\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28023\"></p>\n<p>Set it to \"h\" and you get a high density chart, or essentially a bar chart with skinny bars.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# High-density\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"h\")\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.43.21-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"High density chart\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28022\"></p>\n<p>Set it to \"s\" and you get a step chart.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Step\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"s\")\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.43.26-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Step chart\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28021\"></p>\n<p>There are several other types that you can set it to. Simply enter \"?plot\" in the console to see documentation for the function. Most R functions offer pretty good documentation, which you can access with a question mark followed by the function name. Use this. A lot. It might be a little confusing at first, but the sooner you can read documentation, the easier learning R (or any code really) will be.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few other arguments to tinker with. For example, all the charts you made so far rotate vertical axis labels ninety degrees. Set <code>las</code> to 1 to change the label positions so that they are horizontal.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Changing argument values\r\nplot(education.high$high, las=1)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.58.37-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Default dot plot\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28020\"></p>\n<p>Or change labels for the axes and title with <code>xlab</code>, <code>ylab</code>, and <code>main</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(education.high$high, las=1, xlab=\"States\", ylab=\"Percent\", main=\"At least high school degree or equivalent by state\")\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.59.48-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Dot plot with title and labels\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28019\"></p>\n<p>You can also set the size of shapes (<code>cex</code>), labels (<code>cex.axis</code>), remove border (<code>bty</code>), or change the symbols used (<code>pch</code>).</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(education.high$high, las=1, xlab=\"States\", ylab=\"Percent\", main=\"At least high school degree or equivalent\", bty=\"n\", cex=0.5, cex.axis=0.6, pch=19)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>You get a plot that looks a little cleaner.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.59.55-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Dot plot with changed options\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28018\"></p>\n<h2>Additional charts</h2>\n<p>Although <code>plot()</code> can handle a good bit, there will be times when you want to use other chart types that the function doesn't offer. For example, the function doesn't provide a basic bar chart. Instead, use <code>barplot()</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Bar plot\r\nbarplot(education$high)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>And you get a basic bar plot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-5.18.07-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Default bar chart\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28017\"></p>\n<p>Like the <code>plot()</code> function, there are arguments to fiddle with to get what you want.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Bar plot with changed parameters\r\nbarplot(education$high, names.arg=education$state, horiz=TRUE, las=1, cex.names=0.5, border=NA)\r\n\r\n# Documentation for function\r\n?barplot\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-5.20.06-PM.png\" alt=\"Horizontal bar chart\" width=\"545\" height=\"779\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28016\"></p>\n<p>Similarly, you can use <code>boxplot()</code> to see distributions.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Single box plot\r\nboxplot(education$high)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-5.25.53-PM.png\" alt=\"A box plot\" width=\"528\" height=\"601\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28015\"></p>\n<p>Just as easily, you can make multiple boxplots in a single space.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Multiple box plots for comparison\r\nboxplot(education[,2:4])\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-5.26.05-PM.png\" alt=\"Multiple box plots\" width=\"495\" height=\"794\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28014\"></p>\n<p>Finally, you can set some universal parameters so that you don't have to specify them in every function. For example, <code>mfrow</code> sets the number of rows and columns if you want to show multiple charts in the same window, and <code>mar</code> sets the margins in between charts. Then like in previous examples, you've seen <code>las</code> and <code>bty</code>, but now you don't have to plug it in everywhere.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Multiple charts in one window\r\npar(mfrow=c(3,3), mar=c(2,5,2,1), las=1, bty=\"n\")\r\nplot(education.high$high)\r\nplot(education$high, education$bs)\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"l\")\t# Line\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"h\")\t# High-density\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"s\")\t# Step\r\nbarplot(education$high)\r\nbarplot(education$high, names.arg=education$state, horiz=TRUE, las=1, cex.names=0.5, border=NA)\r\nboxplot(education$high)\r\nboxplot(education[,2:4])\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bam. You get a grid of charts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-5.26.26-PM-625x562.png\" alt=\"Grid of charts\" width=\"625\" height=\"562\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28013\"></p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>Most basic charts only require a couple of lines of code in R, and you can make customizations by changing argument values. Use function documentation, which usually includes code snippets at the end, to learn how to use a new function. Want more? The examples in this tutorial are just tip of <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/category/tutorials/\">the iceberg</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"
