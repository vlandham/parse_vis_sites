That is, instead of relying on citations, they used log data on how readers request papers, in the form of a billion user interactions on various web portals.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Maps of science derived from citation data visualize the relationships among scholarly publications or disciplines. They are valuable instruments for exploring the structure and evolution of scholarly activity. Much like early world charts, these maps of science provide an overall visual perspective of science as well as a reference system that stimulates further exploration. However, these maps are also significantly biased due to the nature of the citation data from which they are derived: existing citation databases overrepresent the natural sciences; substantial delays typical of journal publication yield insights in science past, not present; and connections between scientific disciplines are tracked in a manner that ignores informal cross-fertilization.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Cross-fertilization. Saucy.</p>\n<p>Each circle represents a journal and edges represent connections between journals, according to Johan Bollen et. al's clickstream model. Circles are color-coded by journal classifications from the Getty Research Institute's Art and Architecture Thesaurus.</p>\n<p>So you have most of the engineering and physical sciences on the perimeter, medical-related areas to the left, and liberal arts is that middle cluster. Statistics is towards the top left, mixed in with demographics, philosophy, and sociology. There aren't many surprises in the clusters, but there are interesting, albeit weaker, links in the open spaces, such as religion and chemistry or music and ecology.</p>\n<p>[<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004803');\" href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004803\">PLoS ONE</a> | Thanks, @<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/twitter.com/#!/drewconway/status/153723024833654784');\" href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/drewconway/status/153723024833654784\">drewconway</a>]</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

The five most recent winners were all maps designed by large, well-known institutions: National Geographic (three times), the Central Intelligence Agency Cartography Center, and the U.S. Census Bureau.

Zoomed out, it doesn't look much different from other maps. Zooming in, however, you see something that was carefully crafted by hand. Below is a side-by-side comparison of Chicago on the Imus map (left) and a National Geographic map (right). Disregard the fuzziness in each, as that's the product of a scan. On one you have forestry shading, straight labels, and more emphasis on locations than on interstates.

Before I actually made anything, I read books and guides that made suggestions and preached a handful of design principles, but when it was <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/category/the-times/\">time to make a data graphic</a> for publication, I didn't know what I was doing. Theory is great. Being able to apply it to your own data is better.</p>\n<p>Back then — which seems like forever but isn't actually that long ago — there weren't many practical tutorials or books on how to visualize data. <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/book.flowingdata.com');\" href=\"http://book.flowingdata.com\" title=\"Visualize This\">Visualize This</a> is the book I wish I had when I was starting out. A steady foundation and an introduction to what's out there, written to my old self.</p>\n<p>There's still so much more to visualization though. There are different points of view to explore, new software and methods to try, and growing data sources to play with.</p>\n<p>That's where <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/membership/\">FlowingData memberships</a> come in. Having great sponsors lets me write tutorials and longer articles occasionally, but memberships will allow me to write more and perhaps bring in others' expertise from time to time.</p>\n<p>Here's what you get with <strong>FlowingData membership</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Monthly Tutorials:</strong> How to make and design publication-level data graphics.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Downloads:</strong> Source code and files to use with your own data.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Guides and Resources:</strong> Design principles and the best places to learn them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Curated Links:</strong> Hand-picked links from around the Web that focus on the <em>how</em> of visualization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those who have <em>Visualize This</em> will recognize the style of the guides and tutorials (first members-only tutorial coming soon after this post). You can also check out <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/category/tutorials/\">past tutorials</a> for a taste. Long-time readers will notice a new layout that's easier to follow, and writing online lends itself better to more code-heavy projects.</p>\n<p>All this for the introductory price of $25 per year — less than a coffee a month. I'll also throw in a warm, fuzzy feeling from directly supporting an independent FlowingData. Your support helps ensure that the lights stay on, hopefully for years to come.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/membership/\">Become a member.</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Paypal is acting up. Looking into it now.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> Seems to be going okay again. It might take a couple of tries due to your awesomeness.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 3:</strong> I think most of the kinks have been ironed out, but if you can't log in for some reason, please email me at nathan [at] flowingdata [dot] com.

They looked at 389 Lego sets and compared the number of pieces in the set to the number of piece types, as shown above.<br><span id=\"more-20786\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>This curve demonstrates that as the number of pieces in a set grows, so do the number of piece types. However, the number of piece types grows <em>sublinearly</em>: while a larger set uses more piece types, as sets becomes larger, they use progressively fewer additional piece types (so larger sets actually use fewer types per piece). This is similar to other sublinear curves, where larger animals use less energy per cell for metabolism or larger cities actually need fewer gas stations per capita. Essentially, larger sets become more efficient, using the same pieces that smaller sets do, but in a more complex and diverse way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Now to more important matters... look at this cool thing I made with the Legos my wife got me for Christmas.

So in a way, these items are connected by how people buy. Artist and designer Christopher Warnow uses the metaphor to create a network of Amazon products, where each node represents an item, and connections, or edges, represent common bonds of recommendations. Simply enter an Amazon link, and Warnow's software generates a network.<br><span id=\"more-20983\"></span></p>\n<p>For example, the image above is the network for Edward Tufte's <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/?tag=flowingdata-20');\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/?tag=flowingdata-20\">Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a>, although Stephen Few's <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-Effective-Communication/dp/0596100167/?tag=flowingdata-20');\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-Effective-Communication/dp/0596100167/?tag=flowingdata-20\">Information Dashboard Design</a> seems to have more connections for some reason. My quick guess is that book's that are less niche have more connections, because when I entered Visualize This, the network was pretty small. Although I would've thought that Tufte's book would have a larger network than Few's.</p>\n<p>In any case, the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/christopherwarnow.com/portfolio/?p=278');\" href=\"http://christopherwarnow.com/portfolio/?p=278\">application and Processing code</a> is free to play with. Warnow uses <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/gephi.org/');\" href=\"http://gephi.org/\">Gephi</a> for network connections and grouping.

The map is a work in progress and is still missing the cocaine routes, but hopefully I'll be able to add them shortly.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There's lots to look at and interact with here. To start, there are bubbles that cluster homicides by region and major highway routes in black. </p>\n<p>Click on any bubble and you get a time series for the corresponding area, going back to 2004. Or if you like, draw your own polygon to see the time series for specific regions. Pointers on the time series highlight significant events.

Because the plan is ambitious and implies substantial change, the altered ﬁeld will be called \"data science.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>For those unfamiliar, Cleveland's work on <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2010/03/20/graphical-perception-learn-the-fundamentals-first/\">graphical perception</a> might ring a bell.<br><span id=\"more-21308\"></span></p>\n<p>The first time I heard \"data science\" was in 2007 while reading a proposal that my adviser had passed along, outlining an academic program similar to what we think of as data science. Now that I think of it, the proposal probably had a lot of similarities to the program outlined by Cleveland (which I would have signed up for in a heartbeat).</p>\n<p>Cleveland outlines six areas and the percentage of focus for each.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Multidisciplinary Investigation</strong> (25%) — collaboration with subject areas</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Models and Methods for Data</strong> (20%) — more traditional applied statistics</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Computing with Data</strong> (15%) — hardware, software, and algorithms</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Pedagogy</strong> (15%) — how to teach the subject</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Tool Evaluation</strong> (5%) — keeping track of new tech</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Theory</strong> (20%) — the math behind the data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That sounds like what we associate data science with, but current practitioners focus more on tools and less on pedagogy and theory. Although that's not to say that data scientists today couldn't benefit for more traditional statistical knowledge under their belt. And the same goes for statisticians learning more about how to use the tools available (and how to make the tools themselves).</p>\n<p>Cleveland's overall theme is a melting of various fields that obviously fit well together.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Computer scientists, waking up to the value of the information stored, processed, and transmitted by today's computing environments, have attempted to ﬁll the void. One current of work is data mining. But the beneﬁt to the data analyst has been limited, because the knowledge among computer scientists about how to think of and approach the analysis of data is limited, just as the knowledge of computing environments by statisticians is limited. A merger of the knowledge bases would produce a powerful force for innovation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sounds <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2009/06/04/rise-of-the-data-scientist/\">familiar</a>. Of course, John Tukey seemed to have the <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2008/01/01/john-tukey-and-the-beginning-of-interactive-graphics/\">right idea</a> in the 1970s. In any case, it was refreshing to find this from a statistician over the canned stat scoff that data science <em>is</em> statistics.</p>\n<p>[<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.stat.purdue.edu/~wsc/papers.html');\" href=\"http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wsc/papers.html\">William Cleveland</a> via @<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/twitter.com/drewconway');\" href=\"http://twitter.com/drewconway\">drewconway</a>]</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>In the 1980s, students and researchers at UCLA, led by marketing professor Alan Andreasen, found some interesting spending patterns when people approach major life events.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[W]hen some customers were going through a major life event, like graduating from college or getting a new job or moving to a new town, their shopping habits became flexible in ways that were both predictable and potential gold mines for retailers. The study found that when someone marries, he or she is more likely to start buying a new type of coffee. When a couple move into a new house, they're more apt to purchase a different kind of cereal. When they divorce, there’s an increased chance they'll start buying different brands of beer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>These findings <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html');\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html\">turned out to be the backbone</a> of work by statistician Andrew Pole, who was hired by Target to analyze their data and increase sales. Somewhere along the way, the marketing department at Target asked Pole if there was a way to predict that a customer was expecting a child. Birth records are freely available, so it's easy to send baby-related coupons and advertisements to new mothers, but Target wanted first dibs, before that baby came out. </p>\n<p>As you might expect, Pole found 25 products that were strong indicators and soon he had an estimate of pregnancies with a pregnancy prediction score.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Pole applied his program to every regular female shopper in Target's national database and soon had a list of tens of thousands of women who were most likely pregnant. If they could entice those women or their husbands to visit Target and buy baby-related products, the company’s cue-routine-reward calculators could kick in and start pushing them to buy groceries, bathing suits, toys and clothing, as well. When Pole shared his list with the marketers, he said, they were ecstatic. Soon, Pole was getting invited to meetings above his paygrade. Eventually his paygrade went up.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Creepy or just good marketing? I say the latter.</p>\n<p>[<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html');\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html\">New York Times</a> | Thanks, <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.skunkwrkz.net/');\" href=\"http://www.skunkwrkz.net/\">Paul</a>]</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

Apparently it's still in the early stages and can't handle much data at once. The main hook is automated summaries, model fitting, and some graphs, but if you know enough to interpret the models appropriately, shouldn't you know enough to derive them?</p>\n<p>I'd love to hear initial thoughts from those who have tried it.

It's not just retweets and likes. Bloom Studio, the folks who brought you <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2011/05/11/ben-cerveny-talks-planetary-and-where-they-go-next/\">Planetary</a>, embrace this idea in their just released iPad app, <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/biologic.bloom.io/');\" href=\"http://biologic.bloom.io/\">Biologic</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The basic concept: choose a social network from the Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn blobs on the opening screen.

At first it all may seem quite nerdy (and certainly as I glance back at this blog post there’s a risk of that).

For example, some players are now labeled \"point-forwards\" or \"combo-guards.\" But what if we were wrong about our initial five positions. Maybe a \"Center\" is just a label for people over a certain height, and there are actually three different types of big men in the NBA.</p></blockquote>\n<p>An analysis, done with data exploration tool <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.ayasdi.com/index.php/iris/');\" href=\"http://www.ayasdi.com/index.php/iris/\">Ayasdi Iris</a>, provided 13 possible positions, as shown above.

Dirk Nowitzki might be considered a scoring rebounder, whereas Joakim Noah is a paint protector.</p>\n<p>The point? Hopefully teams can use this information to make better decisions about who to trade and draft. Of course, I'm sure scouts know about these fuzzy positions already, so I think the next step is to look at what positions the best teams have and had, and more importantly, how a \"one-of-a-kind\" player can change everything.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

What did I just read?</p>\n<p>I think most of you know of Freakonomics, but in case you don't, it started as <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060731338/?tag=flowingdata-20');\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060731338/?tag=flowingdata-20\">a book</a> in 2005, by economist Steven Levitt and journalist Stephen Dubner. The book examines corners of life (like cheating in sumo) through data. It's a good read. <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.amazon.com/SuperFreakonomics-Cooling-Patriotic-Prostitutes-Insurance/dp/0060889586/?tag=flowingdata-20');\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/SuperFreakonomics-Cooling-Patriotic-Prostitutes-Insurance/dp/0060889586/?tag=flowingdata-20\">SuperFreakonomics</a> was the follow-up in 2009. <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.freakonomics.com/');\" href=\"http://www.freakonomics.com/\">Freakonomics</a> has since grown up into a media company, complete with documentary, radio show, and blog. Needless to say, it's had a lot of success.</p>\n<p>In the latest issue of <em>American Scientist</em>, statisticians <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.14344,y.0,no.,content.true,page.3,css.print/issue.aspx');\" href=\"http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/id.14344,y.0,no.,content.true,page.3,css.print/issue.aspx\">Kaiser Fung and Andrew Gelman wrote a strong critique</a> of Levitt and Dubner's work.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In our analysis of the Freakonomics approach, we encountered a range of avoidable mistakes, from back-of-the-envelope analyses gone wrong to unexamined assumptions to an uncritical reliance on the work of Levitt’s friends and colleagues. This turns accessibility on its head: Readers must work to discern which conclusions are fully quantitative, which are somewhat data driven and which are purely speculative.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Fung and Gelman then cite examples that they believe erroneous.</p>\n<p>It's not mean-spirited, but Gelman has a way of <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2011/08/15/statistical-graphics-and-information-visualization/\">offending</a> even if he doesn't mean to, so I knew a third of the way through that this could not end well.</p>\n<p><a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.freakonomics.com/2012/03/20/freakonomics-what-went-right-responding-to-wrong-headed-attacks/');\" href=\"http://www.freakonomics.com/2012/03/20/freakonomics-what-went-right-responding-to-wrong-headed-attacks/\">Dubner replied</a>. (Skip part II, which addresses a different issue that shouldn't have been an issue in the first place.) He assesses — after explaining why almost everything that Fung and Gelman wrote is wrong — that they were blinded by their want to disprove.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[O]nce they'd picked up a hammer, did everything look like a nail?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dubner continues:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I can certainly understand why Freakonomics is an appealing target for someone like Gelman-Fung. As I noted earlier, there are strong incentives to attack, particularly in the public sphere, where one can get a ton of attention in a blink by assailing the reputation of someone who's been plugging away for years. Whether in the academy, the media, the political arena, or elsewhere, public discourse these days often seems little more than a tit-for-tat game in which you wait for someone or something to achieve a certain momentum and then shout as loudly as you can that it’s \"wrong!\" Or, in written form: <em>Epic fail</em>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I've only read the first book, which like I said was really good, so I can't really go with either side, but Dubner provides some compelling arguments, and I have a feeling most people will believe him more.</p>\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Gelman <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/andrewgelman.com/2012/03/a-kaleidoscope-of-responses-to-dubners-criticisms-of-our-criticisms-of-freaknomics/');\" href=\"http://andrewgelman.com/2012/03/a-kaleidoscope-of-responses-to-dubners-criticisms-of-our-criticisms-of-freaknomics/\">replies to the reply</a> and Fung <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/2012/03/what-can-we-learn-from-freakonomics.html');\" href=\"http://junkcharts.typepad.com/numbersruleyourworld/2012/03/what-can-we-learn-from-freakonomics.html\">adds to that</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

Instead it's about how data can help you fill in the gaps.</p>\n<p>By the way, if you're not listening to Krulwich's show slash podcast <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.radiolab.org/');\" href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/\">Radiolab</a>, who he co-hosts with Jad Abumrad, you're missing out on some fine storytelling.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

If a transmission case breaks on a durability test vehicle, a problem resolution report documents the problem, and its corresponding LEGO block goes on a LEGO board. The block color identifies the area on the vehicle and the block size denotes severity; the bigger the block, the bigger the problem. Each block has an identification number and date of discovery, and the board shows its progress from root cause to solution to outcome. 3-D Visualization is applicable to any process that has volume and aging.</p></blockquote>\n<p>There's no mention of a computer link in the press release (seems like something worth noting), but it does look like there's a cable coming out from the board.

The survey's mandatory status, along with telephone and in-person follow-ups to initial mailings, helps keep response rates near 100%.</p>\n<p>Now, 60 Republican members of Congress, including presidential candidate and Texas Rep. Ron Paul, are challenging the survey's mandatory status, with a bill that would make it voluntary to complete the ACS. The push is fueled by privacy concerns and the very detailed nature of the questions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Find the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.931:');\" href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.931:\">full details of the bill</a> on the Library of Congress site. Things got interesting when I searched for this link.<br><span id=\"more-23020\"></span></p>\n<p>To me, the ACS seems like it provides a useful collection of data to help decide how to \"dole out more than $400 billion annually.\" That's not something you can do with anecdotes, and statistical estimates will always carry uncertainty with them that most likely will upset underrepresented areas, etc. Higher response rates usually provide better estimates. Plus, having visited the Bureau last summer, I never even remotely got the sense that anyone there was trying to pull a Big Brother. So if an ACS ever lands in my mailbox (or hopefully my inbox, sooner more than later), I'll fill it out to completion.</p>\n<p>This guy, on the other hand, sees things differently, as shown in the video below. He goes through the questions and sarcastically voices his disgust. Then he burns the ACS and ends fittingly with a Ron Paul quote. (Paul, by the way has been against the survey for a while. Here's an article written in <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul192.html');\" href=\"http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul192.html\">2004</a>.)</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"625\" height=\"454\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3vJJ4FZw4fk?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>This guy didn't like it so much either:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"625\" height=\"348\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/B1XzHKYcLB8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Or this woman:</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"625\" height=\"454\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/aCFQC8bXrKs?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Even Glenn Beck had something to say about it in 2009.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"625\" height=\"454\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/rL6712oouzA?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>In fact, you'll find a bunch of these videos with a <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.youtube.com/results?search_query=american+community+survey&amp;oq=american+community');\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=american+community+survey&amp;oq=american+community\">quick search</a> for American Community Survey on YouTube.</p>\n<p>It's odd.

Instead of finishing, he joined the army, fed up with what the British government was doing to stop Hitler.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before I could actually do any of that I was moved to a highly secret experimental station in the south of England. At the time they were bombing London every night and our job was to help to find out what to do if, one night, they used poisonous gas.</p>\n<p>Some of England's best scientists were there. There were a lot of experiments with small animals, I was a lab assistant making biochemical determinations, my boss was a professor of physiology dressed up as a colonel, and I was dressed up as a staff sergeant.</p>\n<p>The results I was getting were very variable and I told my colonel that what we really needed was a statistician.</p>\n<p>He said \"we can't get one, what do you know about it?\" I said \"Nothing, I once tried to read a book about it by someone called R. A. Fisher but I didn't understand it\". He said \"You've read the book so you better do it\", so I said, \"Yes sir\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Box eventually worked with Fischer, studied under E. S. Pearson in college after his discharge from the army, and started the Statistical Techniques Research Group at Princeton on the insistence of one <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2008/01/01/john-tukey-and-the-beginning-of-interactive-graphics/\">John Tukey</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

During evaluations, eye tracking software was employed, and they found that the recruiters spent about six seconds on a resume looking for six main things: name, current company and title, previous company and title, previous position start and end dates, current position start and end dates, and education. After that, it was a crapshoot.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Beyond these six data points, recruiters did little more than scan for keywords to match the open position, which amounted to a very cursory \"pattern matching\" activity. Because decisions were based mostly on the six pieces of data listed above, an individual resume’s detail and explanatory copy became filler and had little to no impact on the initial decision making. In fact, the study’s eye tracking technology shows that recruiters spent about 6 seconds on their initial \"fit/no fit\" decision.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If I ever have to submit a resume, I'm just going to put those six things as bullets and then the rest will all be keywords in small, light print.

This was after seeing <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/narrowthegapp.com/');\" href=\"http://narrowthegapp.com/\">Narrow the Gapp</a> by Gina Trapani and then a Time Magazine cover story on how more women are becoming the main earners of households.

My idea was to combine the two as a recreation of the latter, with a couple of my own interactions. I went to work on a bunch of horrible government PDFs and then pulled it all together.</p>\n<p>(I was mostly interested in what the data looked like. I was hoping to see a counterclockwise turn towards the equal pay gap line, but of course, it's never that simple.)</p>\n<p>At some time late at night, I put up <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/projects.flowingdata.com/salary/');\" href=\"http://projects.flowingdata.com/salary/\">the graphic</a> and hastily <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2012/04/13/gender-wage-gap-how-much-less-women-make-than-men/\">posted</a> about it. I wrote in the footer of the graphic that it was an update to the NYT version that made use of Mike's D3 and left it at that. And that was fine. There were some good comments, and I was happy that Graham and Hannah <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/twitter.com/#!/Grahaphics/status/192006600767188993');\" href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/Grahaphics/status/192006600767188993\">shared</a> it on Twitter.</p>\n<p>But then there was confusion when my graphic went up on CNNMoney a few days later without a nod to NYT. That's when I got my first taste of online bitter. It tastes bad, and it's kind of scary how quick people are to think the worst.</p>\n<p>However, it was an honest mistake by both CNNMoney and me. They didn't catch the note in the footer, so they didn't realize I had recreated the NYT graphic. They were quick to act when they found out though, so good on them. </p>\n<p>As for me, I live in a bubble where I share whatever I want on FlowingData and all the <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/category/projects/\">mini-projects</a> I work on simply come out of my own curiosities. I didn't even think about possible conflicts when I was asked if it was okay to share the graphic. We did something similar with the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/projects.flowingdata.com/walmart/');\" href=\"http://projects.flowingdata.com/walmart/\">Walmart map</a> a while back, and the contrast between comments from CNN's general audience and FlowingData's was fun to see. So I just said sure. I should have thought a little harder. </p>\n<p>Anyways, I've learned my lesson. I'll make recreations more clear — if I do them at all at this point — and no more hasty posts late at night.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

Once data is in a Dataset, it becomes simple to select, group, and calculate properties of, the data. Additionally, Dataset makes it easy to work with real-time and changing data, which pose one of the more complex challenges to data visualization work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gonna keep an eye on this one.

For example, the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program provides annual data to the Department of Education for use in allocating funds to school districts, based on local counts and rates of children in poverty. Without the ACS we would be limited to using smaller surveys (and thus less accurate information about poverty in each school district) or older data (which can become outdated within a few years, such as during the recent recession). Either way, it would hurt our ability to allocate resources fairly to schoolchildren nationwide.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Census Bureau uses the ACS to produce other timely small-area estimates required by Congressional legislation or requested by other agencies: the number of people with health insurance, people with disabilities, minority language speakers, etc. The legislation requires a data source like the ACS not only so that it can be carried out well, but also so its progress can be monitored.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

This is, the data says, a candidate for the worst anachronism of the season. The word \"callback\" is about 100x more common by the 1990s, and \"callback for\" is even worse. The OED doesn't have any examples of a theater-oriented use of \"callback\" until the 1970s; although I bet one could find some examples somewhere earlier in the New York theater scene, that may not save it. It wouldn't really suite Megan's generally dilettantish attitude towards the theater, or the office staff's lack of knowledge of it, for them to be so au courant. \"call-back\" and \"call back\" don't seem much more likely.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Other anachronisms include the use of \"pay phone\" and a frequent use of \"on the phone with\" which didn't peak until the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Don't miss the look into <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.prochronism.com/2012/04/making-downton-more-traditional.html');\" href=\"http://www.prochronism.com/2012/04/making-downton-more-traditional.html\">Downton Abbey anachronisms</a>.

It's rare that good graphics are produced when you go this direction. </p>\n<p>Instead, start with the data (or information) first and then build around that — don't try to fit the data (or information) into a space it wasn't meant for.</p>\n<p>Or maybe there's a lot more in store that we can't see yet.

It terminates the American Community Survey, which produces the social and demographic information that monitors the impact of economic trends on communities throughout the country. It halts crucial development of ways to save money on the next decennial census. In the last three years the Census Bureau has reacted to budget and technological challenges by mounting aggressive operational efficiency programs to make these key statistical cornerstones of the country more cost efficient. Eliminating them halts all the progress to build 21st century statistical tools through those innovations. This bill thus devastates the nation’s statistical information about the status of the economy and the larger society.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A lot of the negative comments following the post are from people who have never used Census data, or any substantial amount of data for that matter, and have no clue how a dataset can feed into a model to make other estimates. Then there's the people who don't want to answer questions about their toilets. I wonder what their Facebook profiles look like.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

Typically a ship will undertake six voyages a year. The fastest-growing routes are between ports in Asia, while goods moving out of that continent account for 43% of all maritime trade, according to IHS Global, an economic forecasting firm. Today the most heavily trafficked sea route is between China and the West Coast of the U.S. The total value of goods that travel from China to the U.S. is four times that of those on the return trip—a clear symbol of America's trade deficit.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Despite a gap of a few centuries, the routes today still look a lot like <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2012/04/12/a-century-of-ocean-shipping-animated/\">the ones from the 18th century</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

This project by <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/mattrichardson.com');\" href=\"http://mattrichardson.com\" title=\"Matt Richardson\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Richardson</a> was on display at the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/itp.nyu.edu/shows/spring2012/category/projects/');\" href=\"http://itp.nyu.edu/shows/spring2012/category/projects/\" title=\"ITP Spring Show\" target=\"_blank\">ITP Spring Show</a>. The basic premise is that you take a photo and the camera spits out a textual description of what it sees. The results are remarkably accurate, detailed, and humorous.<br><span id=\"more-24318\"></span><br>\nHere's what my photo said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A woman wearing a seriously awesome jacket that is printed with yellow, blue, and grey circles looks at her ipad rather than making eye contact with Matt Richardson.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I mean, my jacket *IS* seriously awesome! So it not only described what it saw, but it also has great fashion sense. What a clever programmer you may be thinking.</p>\n<p>Ah, but it's all a ruse. Albeit, a very novel and sly ruse. Matt described being underwhelmed by the EXIF data provided by digital cameras which provides you with things like date, time, camera model, and sometimes geo-spatial info. He wanted to see a world where cameras actually told you about the contents of the photo. Undeterred by the fact that this type of technology isn't feasible or practical right now, Matt decided to take a more human approach. He uses Amazon's <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome');\" href=\"https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome\" title=\"Mechanical Turk\" target=\"_blank\">Mechanical Turk</a> and alternatively, instant messages to his friends, to subvert the computational task of providing a textual description of the photo.</p>\n<p>So back to how this made me rethink data. It struck me that sometimes it's not what's immediately in front of you. Sometimes it's the shadow of the thing that's important; sometimes it's what envelopes it, or connects it to its surroundings, or maybe even a subjective description of what it is. Sometimes it's not a jacket... it's a seriously awesome jacket.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

It has a beautiful interface. The world map is black on a sea of black. Your mouse acts as a sort of flashlight layered between land and water, showing you glimpses of familiar coastlines and allowing you to select dots that tell the stories of extinction.<br><span id=\"more-24289\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>We are experiencing the sixth mass extinction in the planet's history, and the only one to be caused not by a catastrophic event, but by the actions of a single species - mankind. On average, every 20 minutes a distinct living species of plant or animal disappears. At this rate, by some estimates, as much as 30 percent of the world's animals and plants could be on a path to extinction in 100 years.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The site states that the dots on the world map each represent a species, place, or natural phenomenon that has disappeared or significantly diminished. Unfortunately, this is a very vague concept. I chose a dot titled \"Earth\" that described the abundance of life in a cup of soil. Another dot named \"Migration\" discussed how the natural phenomenon of migration was disappearing around the world. It seemed so loosely related to extinction that I felt the mission of the piece fell short. You can also view the dots by year, however, I felt it only added to my confusion because it doesn't seem to chronicle actual extinctions.</p>\n<p>I typically love Maya Lin's work, so this site was surprisingly disappointing and certainly not her best piece of data visualization (see <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial.html');\" href=\"http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial.html\" title=\"Vietnam Veterans Memorial\" target=\"_blank\">Vietnam Veterans Memorial</a>).</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

Well, here it is; it's labeled by its creator as a \"<a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/jonboeckenstedt.wordpress.com/2012/01/18/data-visualization-serendipity/');\" href=\"http://jonboeckenstedt.wordpress.com/2012/01/18/data-visualization-serendipity/\" title=\"Feather chart\" target=\"_blank\">feather chart</a>.\" I really hate to pick on people. I truly think Jon made a valiant attempt to use pie charts innovatively. However, this chart is not effective.</p>\n<p>The chart uses 11 million ACT records (for international readers, that's a standardized test in the US). It's trying to show the relationship between ethnicity and test score and income and test score.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I created the y-axis as the ACT composite score, and then used self-reported income bands as the x-axis. Both are discrete, categorical values, even though ACT is numeric. ACT increases bottom-to-top, and income bands increase left-to-right. At the intersection of each variable is a pie chart, sized by the number of students in that group, and colored by ethnicity</p></blockquote>\n<p>The only problem is that the overlapping pie charts occlude one another. Unless one section of the pie chart dominates and allows the other sections to peek out over the top of the previous pie, then the chart is useless. For instance, in the first feather, there's no way to know if the orange section is 40% or 60% for most of the chart.</p>\n<p>This chart has really good intentions, but the data would be better served with a bean or violin plot.

A search for R used to turn up all sorts of unrelated junk, but it has gotten a lot better.

Sometimes it's simple like \"DontStealMyInternet\" or \"Big Bob's playhouse.\" Others use their SSIDs to make a political statement.

Why is this? It may be that Obama is genuinely more popular in the rest of the world but maybe it is because outside of the US people are less likely to express negative sentiments towards politicians in this manner. We can't answer this definitively but looking at Argentina, at least, does suggest this is the case.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I'm surprised it was so evenly split in the US between negative and positive since in a way it's like putting a sign up on your lawn.

See, it's funny because usually when we talk about labeling axes, we're talking about axes on plots for context, but here axes is used as the plural of axe, so there are labels on several axes. It's a play on words. More specifically, it works because axes on a plot and axes the wood-cutting tool are homographs. They're two words with the same spelling but are pronounced differently. So the joke works with the written word, but it would not work if I were to tell it to you in person. Just to be clear, you should always label both types of axes. Tool and plot, that is. I mean, let's say you asked someone who only knew about axes (the plot kind) to fetch a certain type of axe (the tool) from your woodshed. If you didn't label your axes (the tools), that person wouldn't have a clue. That'd be embarrassing for both parties.

The initial view is a current breakdown of sectors, and when you press play, the visual rewinds to 1960, animating forward in time. Faded people icons represent the peak of each sector for context. Then as you might guess, the people rearrange themselves accordingly when you select breakdowns by age or gender.<br><span id=\"more-25020\"></span></p>\n<p>You can also have a look at the entire trend via stacked bar graph.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Working-in-America-by-year-625x295.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Working in America all years\" width=\"625\" height=\"295\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-25021\"></p>\n<p>The stacked view is hard to decipher actual differences because of the vertical offset, but never fear.

The mill turns to generate power for the building, and in that flow of water are four sensors for oxygen, acidity, nitrates and salinity. Values for these metrics, along with wheel speed, are captured about every thirty minutes. Stephan Thiel of Studio NAND, in collaboration with Moritz Stefaner, <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.flowmill.org/tyne');\" href=\"http://www.flowmill.org/tyne\">visualized this data in an abstracted simulation of the flow through the tidemill</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Particles are continuously moving from right to left, being attracted or repelled by four circular zones representing the sensor values. The overall behavior of the particles is influenced by the turning speed of the waterwheel. If the value of one sensor is above its mean value, particles are repelled. If the value is below the mean, particles are attracted towards the center of the zone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For example, if all four values are greater than the mean, you end up with four circular swells around these zones. In the above, oxygen is below the mean, so the simulated flows head towards the center of the oxygen zone instead of move around it like with the three zones before. So you end up with a sort of fingerprint for each window of data capture.</p>\n<p>The data itself is probably of little interest to anyone who doesn't work at the mill, but the aesthetics of the piece is calming and certainly evokes the context of what the data represents. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2012/03/28/live-wind-map-shows-flow-patterns/\">wind map</a> by Wattenberg and Viegas and <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2011/05/09/where-the-water-resources-are-and-where-it-goes/\">Drawing Water</a> by Wicks come to mind.

It is not unimaginable wealth. It is a very modest £12 706.60 per person per raid. Indeed, it is so low that it is not worth the banks’ while to spend as little as £4500 per cashier position at every branch on rising screens to deter them.</p>\n<p>A single bank raid, even a successful one, is not going to keep our would-be robber in a life of luxury. It is not going to keep him long in a life of any kind. Given that the average UK wage for those in full-time employment is around £26 000, it will give him a modest lifestyle for no more than 6 months. If he decides to make a career of it, and robs two banks a year to make a sub-average income, his chances of eventually getting caught will increase: at 0.8 probability per raid, after three raids or a year and a half his odds of remaining at large are 0.8×0.8×0.8=0.512; after four raids he is more likely than not to be inside. As a profitable occupation, bank robbery leaves a lot to be desired.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Be sure to read the full article for more details on the varying gains and losses when the team is bigger and whether or not a gun is used. Spoiler: an additional member to the robbing team raises the expected haul by about £9,000, and the use of a firearm raises the expected output by about £10,000.

For the past few years, a couple of times a week, there's an article about all the data we have access to and how we're struggling to stay afloat in the growing sea of data. Big data is getting too big they say. </p>\n<p>The water metaphor is fine, but the fear of the data flow is irrational, so let's <del datetime=\"2012-06-16T21:52:55+00:00\">run</del> swim with the former.<br><span id=\"more-24969\"></span></p>\n<p>First, the floods and tsunamis. This makes it sound as if the flows of data are uncontrolled, and there's no way to contain them when they storm to our doorstep. However, you could just turn off the nozzle, or filter, cut, and query to what you want. And these days, we practically have infinite storage, so although the source of water increases, the reservoir and dam can grow with it. </p>\n<p>Hit delete if the data gets too big, or bottle it and save it for later.</p>\n<p>When you learn to swim, you start at the shallow end, and work your way towards the deep end. If you're more adventurous, you snorkel or go deep sea diving. Even then you don't swim the entire ocean right away. You explore a little bit at a time. You chip away at the database a little bit at a time, and what you learn during one dive carries over to the next. Sure, people drown in the ocean, but the good news is that when you drown in data, you still get more chances to learn and try again.</p>\n<p>You don't even have to go to the ocean right away. Although they're small, ponds and lakes can be interesting too. (Think hyperlocal.) If you really must, make friends with one of those guys from <em>Deadliest Catch</em> and have him bring you what you want to study. Better yet, become a greenhorn with the best captain you can find and learn the subtleties of the sea.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, more data means more opportunity, and if you know how to doggy paddle, you're going to be okay. Know how to do more than that? All the better. Keep learning. </p>\n<p>Even if you can't swim, there are a variety of alternatives — life preservers, rafts, and those inflatable floating chairs with the cup holder to put your ice cold beer. Drowning in data? Nah.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

There are statistics here and there, but none provide a good overview of the probabilities. Mathematician Richie Cotton crunched some numbers using monthly fecundity rate — the monthly chance of getting pregnant — <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/4dpiecharts.com/2012/06/15/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-pregnant/');\" href=\"http://4dpiecharts.com/2012/06/15/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-pregnant/\">to estimate about how long it would take for he and his girlfriend to conceive</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>[A]lmost half of the (healthy) 25 year olds get pregnant in the first month, and after two years (the point when doctors start considering you to have fertility problems) more than 90% of 35 year olds should conceive. By contrast, just over 20% of 45 year old women will. In fact, even this statistic is over-optimistic: at this age, fertility is rapidly decreasing, and a 1% MFR at age 45 will mean a much lower MFR at age 47 and the negative binomial model breaks down.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, there are other factors to consider like male fertility and how often a couple has sex, but there you go.</p>\n<p>[via <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2012/06/trying-for-a-baby.html');\" href=\"http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2012/06/trying-for-a-baby.html\">Revolutions</a>]</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

Well deserved. On infographics and the growing number of tools to make them:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stamen finds inspiration everywhere, but Rodenbeck hopes that the public will stop conflating infographics with data visualization. \"The rise of the infographic as a genre is a little depressing. Back when desktop publishing started, people were worried that there would be no more room for designers, that computers would do all the work for you. But this clearly didn't turn out to be the case.\" While someone without design training [<em>or skill — E</em>] could make use of desktop publishing to create a holiday card or office leaflet or company newsletter, the band at the top for good designers actually grew. In a similar way, he says, \"infographics have become the mother's day cards — the company newsletters — of data visualization.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>It's like that with anything that involves creation really. Someone makes some software so that the computer can do some of the work for you, but it'll never be able to do all the work. R can spit out graphics, but you still have to decide what bits of the output to use and interpret what's in front of you. People find this out and what it takes to make something worthwhile when they try to do it themselves.</p>\n<p>Whenever a new site pops up to make infographic creation a snap, my Twitter feed bubbles with gripes and scoffs. Once all those applications come out of beta though, I think we (the data folk) are still gonna be okay.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

In order to quantify these splits, we ran a Moran's I test for spatial auto-correlation which proved to be highly significant as well. Without going into too much detail, this test shows which counties with high numbers of church tweets are surrounded by counties with similar patterns (marked in red) and which counties with many beer tweets are surrounded by like-tweeting counties (marked in blue). Intriguingly there is a clear regional (largely north-south split) in tweeting topics which highlights the enduring nature of local cultural practices even when using the latest technologies for communication.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I wonder if searches for \"ate too much\" or \"out for a run\" would match up with obesity trends.

In the days before online trip planners and GPS, if you wanted to know how to get from point A to point B, you would look at a map and trace out a route. But these days few people would use a map that way (I still do just because I enjoy the process but I think I'm in the minority). Instead, they would plug in their request and an algorithm would spit out a route for them. The route would appear on the map, but the map is no longer the tool for finding that answer.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In other words, just because the data has latitude and longitude attached to it, which seems like everything these days, you don't need to automatically assume that you should throw it on a map.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

Both are basically tricks. \"Instead of buying something and getting a rebate,\" Poundstone writes, \"why not just pay a lower price in the first place?' </p>\n<p>\"[Warranties] make no rational sense,\" Harvard economist David Cutler told the Washington Post. \"The implied probability that [a product] will break has to be substantially greater than the risk that you can't afford to fix it or replace it.

Out of more than 685,000 stops in 2011, about 770 guns were recovered.

The police don't have a clue what they're doing,\" which was one possibility the article suggested. The other was that the stops are working as a deterrent. </p>\n<p>What's more likely: Police officers have managed to end up in almost every area where there are fewer guns (and missed where there are more guns), or people with guns avoid the areas where there are a lot officers? I'm gonna go with the police point of view on this one.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

The smaller disparities are no less striking. For example, between Lancaster Gate and Mile End (20 minutes on the Central line) life expectancy decreases by 12 years and crossing the Thames between Pimlico and Vauxhall sees life expectancy drop by 6 years. The stations serving the Olympic Park fair badly and contrast with the Olympic volleyball venue at Earl’s Court whose spectators will be passing through areas with far higher life expectancies and lower child poverty</p></blockquote>\n<p>The tube map metaphor is typically a stretch, in line with the periodic table of whatever, but this actually works.

If, however, the name \"statistician\" is avoided because that connotes not <em>a powerful discipline which transforms profound ideas about learning from experience into practical tools</em>, but rather, <em>a meaningless conglomeration of rituals better conducted with twenty-sided dice</em>, then we as a profession have failed ourselves and, more importantly, the public, and the blame lies with us.

Last time we tuned in, swimsuit technology had progressed so far that human torpedos in rubber suits set new marks almost hourly in Beijing, particularly in shorter events. But times got slower after the suits were banned in 2010, and only one \"shiny suit\" record has been broken since then in an individual event of 400 meters or less.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They use a swimming pool metaphor, with the horizontal axis as time, and the vertical axis as the number of seconds shaved off from standing records pre-1998. Each dot represents a broken record, and the gray paths, for each event, indicate how long each record stood for. So when you press play, paths are drawn left to right, top to bottom, and black dots pop up for every new record.</p>\n<p>As a standalone animation, the base of this graphic would be fun to watch, but there's a layer of context and interaction that makes it more interesting.</p>\n<p>The illustrations on top provide direction and focus, whereas without them, it'd look a lot like a standard timeline. With them, you get a instant sense of what you're looking at.</p>\n<p>Then when you first press play, the animation pauses at 1996 to give you a short explanation of what you just saw. Click to continue, and labels popup and fade on major events, which serves as a quick explanation of why there were so many broken records all at once.</p>\n<p>Finally, once the animation completes, you can use the tabs on the left to highlight paths for specific events. The best time is shown at the end of the path. The only thing left to do is to provide information for each dot (like who the swimmer is), but the focus here is on the patterns of the suit rather than the individual swimmers, so no biggie. Actually, it's probably better without.

Emoto, a team effort by Drew Hemment, Moritz Stefaner, and Studio NAND, is <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/emoto2012.org/');\" href=\"http://emoto2012.org/\">a Twitter tracker that aggregates sentiment around topics</a>.<br><span id=\"more-26191\"></span></p>\n<blockquote><p>We search twitter for general terms related to the Olympics. Within these search results, we look for individual topics, like athletes, disciplines, venues, or also general topics like \"traffic\" or \"suprise\". Then, the text of each tweet is analysed for emotional words using the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.lexalytics.com/');\" href=\"http://www.lexalytics.com/\">lexalytics software</a>, resulting in a sentiment score ranging from -6 (very negative) over 0 (neutral) to 6 (very positive). As this project is about mapping emotions, our visualisation uses only tweets which can be assigned a sentiment value.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In line with the London 2012 logo, Emoto pieces together triangles to show this sentiment. The top yellow triangle indicates a very positive tweet, whereas a dark blue triangle far to the bottom indicates a very negative tweet. The triangles in between indicate sentiment scores in the middle, and the triangles are sized by the number of tweets that day.</p>\n<p>There's a view that lets you passively watch tweets as they come in live, which will be fun to see when something significant happens, but it'll probably get most interesting when you can compare over time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/olympic-topic-history-625x401.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"olympic topic history\" width=\"625\" height=\"401\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-26197\"></p>\n<p>I'm sure there's some skepticism about the triangles over everyone's favorite bar graphs, but there's so much fuzziness in tweet sentiment analysis that I don't think it matters that much.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

These English comics from the late 1940s and early '50s had recurring one-page (usually funny) stories featuring a cast of regular characters. They had names like Biffo the Bear, Lord Snooty, and Desperate Dan. The comics were printed on poor-quality newsprint, which seemed to go yellow as you were reading it, but there was something very attractive about them.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I like the small dig on Tufte around the middle, while citing <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753716');\" href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1753716\">the paper</a> that happens to find that Holmes' graphics were more memorable than basic charts.</p>\n<blockquote><p>My own work at first was a little too illustrative, and Edward Tufte made a big fuss about what he thought was the trivialization of data.

Like a baseball umpire, a weather forecaster rarely gets credit for getting the call right. Last summer, meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center were tipped off to something serious when nearly all their computer models indicated that a fierce storm was going to be climbing the Northeast Corridor. The eerily similar results between models helped the center amplify its warning for Hurricane Irene well before it touched down on the Atlantic shore, prompting thousands to evacuate their homes. To many, particularly in New York, Irene was viewed as a media-manufactured nonevent, but that was largely because the Hurricane Center nailed its forecast. Six years earlier, the National Weather Service also made a nearly perfect forecast of Hurricane Katrina, anticipating its exact landfall almost 60 hours in advance. If public officials hadn’t bungled the evacuation of New Orleans, the death toll might have been remarkably low.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I like the bit later in the article that describes the number crunching machine and how humans are involved in the analysis. The National Weather Service has heavy-duty computing power to process data coming from weather stations across the country, but the computer is still bad at doing a lot of things.</p>\n<p>To most people, statistics means plugging numbers into an advanced calculator that spits out values, without much thought involved.

And finally, one of the most overwhelming trends we found as we explored this graphic is the strong tie that remains between nations and their former colonizers, whose continued linguistic, cultural, and economic ties still echo today.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stamen also <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/content.stamen.com/facebook_mapping_the_worlds_friendships');\" href=\"http://content.stamen.com/facebook_mapping_the_worlds_friendships\">explained other interesting facets</a> in the map.</p>\n<p>When you click on a country, the map updates to show where friends of those in that country are from. The top five are labeled. So whereas previous Facebook maps <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2010/12/13/facebook-worldwide-friendships-mapped/\">showed all connections</a> at once, which focused on how many people use the service, this one focuses on the actual connections and what they mean.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

(I don't think Alberto remembers, but what seems like many years ago, I sat right behind him for two weeks at the New York Times when they brought him in to help illustrate <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/08/25/sports/tennis/20070827_NADAL_GRAPHIC.html');\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/08/25/sports/tennis/20070827_NADAL_GRAPHIC.html\">Raphael Nadal's approach to tennis</a>.) </p>\n<p>His experience is hugely important in making the book work. There's a growing number of books on information graphics, and many are written and illustrated by people who don't have much experience displaying information, which leads to art books posing as something else. This isn't one of those books. Cairo knows what he's talking about.</p>\n<p>As you flip through, you'll notice a lot of examples, with a focus on process and even a handful of pencil sketches. The last third of the book is interviews with those well-established in the field, which also walks you through how some graphics were made. There's a strong undertone of finding the balance between function (e.g. efficiency and accuracy) and engagement (e.g. use of circles).</p>\n<p>Cairo comes from a journalism background, so the book is mostly in the context of presentation, but there's of course plenty that you can apply to more exploratory graphics. I would say though that Cairo's strength is in illustration and information, and so the book reflects that. This isn't a book that covers visual data analysis or statistical concepts, but it is one that explores and describes the making of high quality information graphics that lend clarity to concepts and ideas. If you're looking for the latter, <em>The Functional Art</em> is worth your time.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.peachpit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321834739');\" href=\"http://www.peachpit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321834739\">sample chapter</a> on the publisher page, but then <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.amazon.com/Functional-Art-introduction-information-visualization/dp/0321834739/?tag=flowingdata-20');\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Functional-Art-introduction-information-visualization/dp/0321834739/?tag=flowingdata-20\">grab it on Amazon</a> and save a few bucks.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

Some compounds end up sounding clear and distinct, while others blur together into unresolvable chords. The result is a qualitative, sensory experience of hard, digital data.

They should have the freedom to experiment and explore possibilities. That said, they need close relationships with the rest of the business. The most important ties for them to forge are with executives in charge of products and services rather than with people overseeing business functions.

That's a huge change from the old days, when bags were dropped into the \"black box\" of a manually sorted baggage system. But crucially, an ABT doesn't just contain a bar code—it's also custom-printed with your name, flight details, and destination. That made the global implementation of ABTs much easier, because early-adopters could introduce them long before every airport was ready—a huge advantage when it comes to seamlessly connecting the world's least and most advanced airports. And of course, ABTs can still be read manually when systems break down.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It's funny how something so commonplace like a sticky loop label goes through these iterations. There are people behind these things who think about the ins and outs of how something works, no matter how small they might seem, so that we don't have to. We just tear them off, toss 'em in the trash, and move on to the next one, because that's what they were made for.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

In Letter 156 Tolkien writes that \"a good Númenórean died of free will when he felt it be the time to do so\". With the Shadow and the Downfall of Númenor this grace was taken away from them and they died involuntarily with a decreasing lifespan. </p>\n<p>The decreasing life span is seen clearly in the graph. The most dramatic change is shortly before the Downfall of Númenor. The rulers are shown in order.

But it turns out it is actually a pretty important thing to know and relevant to those of us on the East Coast right now.

The apps are meant to run locally, so to share an application with someone, you have to send them the code for them to run on their own.

Each beat is then analyzed and matched to other similar sounding beats in the song. This information is used to create a detailed song graph of paths though similar sounding beats. As the song is played, when the next beat has similar sounding beats there’s a chance that we will branch to a completely different part of the song. Since the branching is to a very similar sounding beat in the song, you (in theory) won’t notice the jump. This process of branching to similar sounding beats can continue forever, giving you an infinitely long version of the song.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

Triangles in each country represent programs and are colored by the three above categories, and you might recognize Moritz' <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/2010/05/26/elastic-lists-code-open-sourced/\">elastic lists</a> in the sidebar to filter through programs, by country, organization, and type.

Singapore was ranked least emotional, whereas the Philippines was ranked most emotional. The United States was also relatively high. <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.gallup.com/poll/158882/singapore-ranks-least-emotional-country-world.aspx');\" href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/158882/singapore-ranks-least-emotional-country-world.aspx\">From Gallup</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While higher incomes may improve people's emotional wellbeing, they can only do so to a certain extent. In the United States, for example, Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman and Princeton economist Angus Deaton found that after individuals make $75,000 annually, additional income will have little meaningful effect on how they experience their lives. Consider this finding in the context of Singapore, a country with one of the lowest unemployment rates and highest GDP per capita rates in the world, but a place where residents barely experience any positive emotions. This research shows that it will take more than higher incomes to increase positive emotions or decrease negative emotions. Singapore leadership needs to consider strategies that lie outside of the traditional confines of classic economics and would be well-advised to include wellbeing in its overall strategies if it is going to further improve the lives of its citizenry.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I'm curious about what we're seeing here though. The research infers wellbeing, but the survey was done by phone and face-to-face. Did Americans call overseas, or did residents call other citizens? The former might be kind of weird for some.</p>\n<p>More importantly though, they asked questions like \"Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?\" and \"Did you experience enjoyment?\" Some cultures just don't express emotions, but it doesn't mean they don't feel them. (Read as: I'm not a robot! I have feelings, too!) </p>\n<p>[Thanks, John]</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

A branch line connects a character's crossover from original show to spin-off and vice versa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's a charming piece that's sure to bring back good memories for anyone who watched the shows.

    "content": "<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>So you want to make some charts in R, but you don't know where to begin. This straightforward tutorial should teach you the basics, and give you a good idea of what you want to do next.<br><span id=\"more-27945\"></span></p>\n<h2>Install R</h2>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">I know, I know, the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/r-project.org');\" href=\"http://r-project.org\">R homepage</a> looks horrible, but just ignore that part.</span>Of course, you need to actually have R installed and running on you computer before you do anything. You can download R for Windows, OS X, or Linux <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/cran.stat.ucla.edu/');\" href=\"http://cran.stat.ucla.edu/\">here</a>. For Windows, download the base and the latest version. It's a .exe file and quick installation. For OS X, download the latest .pkg, which is also a one-click install. For the Linux folk, I'll leave you to your own devices.</p>\n<h2>Loading and handling data</h2>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">A <em>function</em> is a way to tell the computer what to do. The <code>c()</code> function is short for \"combine\" so you essentially tell the computer (in the R language) to combine the values.</span>You have to load and be able to handle data before you can chart it. No data means no chart. Enter the <em>vector</em>. It's a structure in R that you use to store data, and you use it often. Use the <code>c()</code> function to create one, as shown in the line of code below. (Hopefully, you've opened R by now. Enter this in the window that opened up aka the <em>console</em>.)</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Vector\r\nc(1,2,3,4,5)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Imagine that the values 1 through 5 are data points that you want to access later. When you enter the above, you create a vector of values, and it's just sort of gone. To save it for later, assign the vector to a <em>variable</em>.</p>\n<p><code></code></p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Assign to variable\r\nfakedata &lt;- c(1,2,3,4,5)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this example, the variable name is \"fakedata.\" Now if you want to access the first value in the fakedata vector, use the syntax below where 1 is the <em>index</em>. You get back the value in that spot in the vector. Try using other indicies and see what values come up.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Access a value from vector\r\nfakedata[1]\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Did you try using an index greater than five? That would give you an \"NA\" value, which is R's way of saying that there's nothing in that place (because the vector only has a length of five).</p>\n<p>Create another vector, <code>morefake</code>, of all a's. Notice the quotes around the a's to indicate that those are <em>characters</em> and not variables and that this new vector is of the same length as <code>fakedata</code>. Then use the <code>cbind()</code> function to combine the two to see what you get.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Matrix, values converted to characters\r\nmorefake &lt;- c(\"a\", \"a\", \"a\", \"a\", \"a\")\r\ncbind(fakedata, morefake)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>When you combine the two vectors, you get a <em>matrix</em> with two columns and five rows. The numbers have quotes around them too now, because a matrix can only have one data type. The <code>fakedata</code> vector has numeric values and again, the <code>morefake</code> vector has all character values.</p>\n<p>However, in many cases (as you'll see soon), you want a structure that has all your values, but with columns of different data types. The <em>data frame</em> in R lets you do this, and it's where most of your CSV-formatted data will go. Create a data frame from multiple vectors as follows:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nfake.df &lt;- data.frame(cbind(fakedata, morefake))\r\nfake.df$morefake &lt;- as.character(fake.df$morefake)\r\ncolnames(fake.df)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>You use <code>cbind()</code> again to combine the vectors, and then pass the resulting matrix to <code>data.frame()</code>. Then convert the column that contains <code>morefake</code> values back to characters. </p>\n<p>The dollar sign ($) syntax is important here. The data frame is assigned to the variable <code>fake.df</code>. The column names are automatically assigned the variable names of the vectors, so to access the <code>morefake</code> column, follow the data frame variable, <code>fake.df</code>, with a dollar sign and the column name.</p>\n<h3>Loading a CSV file</h3>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">The CSV file is included in the downloadable source linked at the beginning of this tutorial. Be sure to set your working directory in R to the directory where the file is via the Misc &gt; Change Working Directory... menu.</span>With data frame and vectors in mind, load \"2009education.csv\" with <code>read.csv()</code>. The data is assigned to the <code>education</code> variable as a data frame, so you can access rows and columns using index values. However, unlike the vector, the data frame is two-dimensional (rows and columns), so use two indices separated with a comma. The first index is the row number, and the second is the column number.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\neducation &lt;- read.csv(\"2009education.csv\", header=TRUE, sep=\",\", as.is=TRUE)\r\neducation[1,]\t\t# First row\r\neducation[1:10,]\t# First ten rows\r\neducation$state\t\t# First columnn\r\neducation[,1]\t\t# Also first column\r\neducation[1,1]\t\t# First cell\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>The data are US state estimates for people with at least high school degrees, bachelors, or higher — one column for each education level.</p>\n<p>It's often useful to sort rows by a certain column. For example, you can sort states by the percentage of people with at least high school diplomas, least to greatest, using the <code>order()</code> function. The function gives you a vector of indices, which you pass to the <code>education</code> data frame and assign to <code>education.high</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Sort least to greatest\r\nhigh.order &lt;- order(education$high)\t\t\t\r\neducation.high &lt;- education[high.order,]\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Similarly, you can order from greatest to least by setting decreasing to TRUE in <code>order()</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Sort greatest to least\r\nhigh.order &lt;- order(education$high, decreasing=TRUE)\r\neducation.high &lt;- education[high.order,]\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Okay, you got the data. On to charts. </p>\n<h2>Basic plotting</h2>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">It's not <em>that</em> smart though. But at least it won't crash on you.</span>R has a <code>plot()</code> function that is kind of smart in that it adapts to the data that you pass it. For example, plot <code>fakedata</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(fakedata)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's only a one-dimensional vector, so by default, R uses a dot plot with the values of the vector on the vertical axis and indices on the horizontal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.30.54-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Dot plot and fake data\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28027\"></p>\n<p>However, try to plot the education data frame, as shown below, and you get an error.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(education)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>The <code>plot()</code> function gets mixed up, because it doesn't know what to do with the first column, which is state names, and the other columns which are numeric values. What if you plot just one column?</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(education.high$high)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.38.05-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Scatter plot\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28025\"></p>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">This shouldn't surprise you, because when you passed <code>education.high$high</code> to <code>plot()</code>, you gave it a vector, just like in the <code>fakedata</code> example.</span>As you might expect, you get a dot plot, where each dot represents a state. Again, indicies are on the horizontal, and high school estimates are on the vertical.</p>\n<p>Want a scatter plot with high school on the horizontal and bachelors on the vertical? Pass <code>plot()</code> both columns of data.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(education$high, education$bs)\r\nplot(education[,2:3])\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>The two lines of code above give you same plot. What if you pass three columns?</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Passing multiple columns\r\nplot(education[,2:4])\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>You get a scatter plot matrix. The bachelor degree and advanced degree rates are strongly correlated.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.42.44-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Scatter plot matrix\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28024\"></p>\n<h2>Using arguments</h2>\n<p>When you pass different valus to functions, you actually set the value of arguments. Change the values, and you get different output and charts. For example, the <code>plot()</code> function has a <code>type</code> argument, which use to specify the type of chart you want. If you don't specify, R will guess and use dots by default.</p>\n<p>Set type to \"l\" and you get a line chart.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Line\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"l\")\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class=\"tip\">You would never use a line chart for this particular dataset, but for the sake of simplicity, let's pretend that it's useful.</span><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.43.10-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Line chart\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28023\"></p>\n<p>Set it to \"h\" and you get a high density chart, or essentially a bar chart with skinny bars.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# High-density\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"h\")\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.43.21-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"High density chart\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28022\"></p>\n<p>Set it to \"s\" and you get a step chart.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Step\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"s\")\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.43.26-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Step chart\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28021\"></p>\n<p>There are several other types that you can set it to. Simply enter \"?plot\" in the console to see documentation for the function. Most R functions offer pretty good documentation, which you can access with a question mark followed by the function name. Use this. A lot. It might be a little confusing at first, but the sooner you can read documentation, the easier learning R (or any code really) will be.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few other arguments to tinker with. For example, all the charts you made so far rotate vertical axis labels ninety degrees. Set <code>las</code> to 1 to change the label positions so that they are horizontal.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Changing argument values\r\nplot(education.high$high, las=1)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.58.37-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Default dot plot\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28020\"></p>\n<p>Or change labels for the axes and title with <code>xlab</code>, <code>ylab</code>, and <code>main</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(education.high$high, las=1, xlab=\"States\", ylab=\"Percent\", main=\"At least high school degree or equivalent by state\")\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.59.48-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Dot plot with title and labels\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28019\"></p>\n<p>You can also set the size of shapes (<code>cex</code>), labels (<code>cex.axis</code>), remove border (<code>bty</code>), or change the symbols used (<code>pch</code>).</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\nplot(education.high$high, las=1, xlab=\"States\", ylab=\"Percent\", main=\"At least high school degree or equivalent\", bty=\"n\", cex=0.5, cex.axis=0.6, pch=19)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>You get a plot that looks a little cleaner.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-4.59.55-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Dot plot with changed options\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28018\"></p>\n<h2>Additional charts</h2>\n<p>Although <code>plot()</code> can handle a good bit, there will be times when you want to use other chart types that the function doesn't offer. For example, the function doesn't provide a basic bar chart. Instead, use <code>barplot()</code>.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Bar plot\r\nbarplot(education$high)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>And you get a basic bar plot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-5.18.07-PM-625x461.png\" alt=\"Default bar chart\" width=\"625\" height=\"461\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28017\"></p>\n<p>Like the <code>plot()</code> function, there are arguments to fiddle with to get what you want.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Bar plot with changed parameters\r\nbarplot(education$high, names.arg=education$state, horiz=TRUE, las=1, cex.names=0.5, border=NA)\r\n\r\n# Documentation for function\r\n?barplot\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-5.20.06-PM.png\" alt=\"Horizontal bar chart\" width=\"545\" height=\"779\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28016\"></p>\n<p>Similarly, you can use <code>boxplot()</code> to see distributions.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Single box plot\r\nboxplot(education$high)\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-5.25.53-PM.png\" alt=\"A box plot\" width=\"528\" height=\"601\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28015\"></p>\n<p>Just as easily, you can make multiple boxplots in a single space.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Multiple box plots for comparison\r\nboxplot(education[,2:4])\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-5.26.05-PM.png\" alt=\"Multiple box plots\" width=\"495\" height=\"794\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28014\"></p>\n<p>Finally, you can set some universal parameters so that you don't have to specify them in every function. For example, <code>mfrow</code> sets the number of rows and columns if you want to show multiple charts in the same window, and <code>mar</code> sets the margins in between charts. Then like in previous examples, you've seen <code>las</code> and <code>bty</code>, but now you don't have to plug it in everywhere.</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: r; title: ; notranslate\" title=\"\">\r\n# Multiple charts in one window\r\npar(mfrow=c(3,3), mar=c(2,5,2,1), las=1, bty=\"n\")\r\nplot(education.high$high)\r\nplot(education$high, education$bs)\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"l\")\t# Line\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"h\")\t# High-density\r\nplot(education.high$high, type=\"s\")\t# Step\r\nbarplot(education$high)\r\nbarplot(education$high, names.arg=education$state, horiz=TRUE, las=1, cex.names=0.5, border=NA)\r\nboxplot(education$high)\r\nboxplot(education[,2:4])\r\n</pre>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bam. You get a grid of charts.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://flowingdata.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-15-at-5.26.26-PM-625x562.png\" alt=\"Grid of charts\" width=\"625\" height=\"562\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-28013\"></p>\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n<p>Most basic charts only require a couple of lines of code in R, and you can make customizations by changing argument values. Use function documentation, which usually includes code snippets at the end, to learn how to use a new function. Want more? The examples in this tutorial are just tip of <a href=\"http://flowingdata.com/category/tutorials/\">the iceberg</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"clear-line\"></div>\n</div>"

It made me wonder: what would my income tax be if I had earned the equivalent of what I earn now several decades ago—or even in 1913, when the current federal income tax program was first introduced? What would the history of income taxes look like through the collective eyes of people in my exact financial situation over the past 100 years?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Just enter your taxable income and filing status, and you get a time series of what your tax rate would've been years ago. It's kind of fun to mouse right to left to see your inflation-adjusted income.</p>\n<p>See also the <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/30/us/tax-burden.html');\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/11/30/us/tax-burden.html\">New York Times piece</a> from last month, which makes for an interesting contrast.

The course will begin with an overview of how to organize, perform, and write-up data analyses. Then we will cover some of the most popular and widely used statistical methods like linear regression, principal components analysis, cross-validation, and p-values. Instead of focusing on mathematical details, the lectures will be designed to help you apply these techniques to real data using the R statistical programming language, interpret the results, and diagnose potential problems in your analysis.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The course starts on January 22, 2013.</p>\n<p>You might also be interested in <a onclick=\"javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outgoing/www.coursera.org/course/compdata');\" href=\"https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata\">Computing for Data Analysis</a> taught by Roger Peng, who is also a biostatistics professor at John Hopkins.
